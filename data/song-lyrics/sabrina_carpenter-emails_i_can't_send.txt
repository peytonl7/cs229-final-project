[Verse]
It's times like these, wish I had a time machine
So I could see what you did October 13th
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no "us" in us when I'm lackin' trust
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fuckin' fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you
[Outro]
(You too)
I mean, as they say in Chicago
"He had it comin'"
