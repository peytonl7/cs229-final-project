[Verse 1]
I don't wanna share the space
I don't wanna force a smile
This one girl taps my insecurities
Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiraling
One voice tells me that they laugh
George says I'm just paranoid
Says he just don't see it, he's so naive
I'm embarassed to have it, but need the sympathy
[Chorus]
'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know why
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know
[Verse 2]
Why I wanna buy a gun?
Why I wanna shoot myself?
Volatilе at war with my dialogue
I'd say that there was a God if thеy could stop this
Wild voice tearing me apart
I'm so apprehensive now
Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show
Fingers crossed behind my back
I hope they break up quick
[Chorus]
'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know why
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
I feel all these feelings I can't control (Oh no)
[Outro]
All this sympathy is just a knife
All this sympathy is just a knife
All this sympathy is just a knife
Yeah, all this sympathy is just a knife
Oh no, oh no
Why is all this sympathy a fucking knife?
Yeah, all this sympathy is just a knife
Couldn't even be her if I tried
Oh no, oh no
