In 1977 the couple moved to New Jersey, where their two children were born. In July 1987 the Burnhams decided to separate. They agreed that Mrs. Burnham, who intended to move to California, would take custody of the children. Shortly before Mrs. Burnham departed for California that same month, she and petitioner agreed that she would file for divorce on grounds of ""irreconcilable differences."" / In October 1987, petitioner filed for divorce in New Jersey state court on grounds of ""desertion."" Petitioner did not, however, obtain an issuance of summons against his wife and did not attempt to serve her with process. Mrs. Burnham, after unsuccessfully demanding that petitioner adhere to *608 their prior agreement to submit to an ""irreconcilable differences"" divorce, brought suit for divorce in California state court in early January 1988. / In late January, petitioner visited southern California on business, after which he went north to visit his children in the San Francisco Bay area, where his wife resided. He took the older child to San Francisco for the weekend. Upon returning the child to Mrs. Burnham's home on January 24, 1988, petitioner was served with a California court summons and a copy of Mrs. Burnham's divorce petition. He then returned to New Jersey. / Later that year, petitioner made a special appearance in the California Superior Court, moving to quash the service of process on the ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because his only contacts with California were a few short visits to the State for the purposes of conducting business and visiting his children. The Superior Court denied the motion, and the California Court of Appeal denied mandamus relief, rejecting petitioner's contention that the Due Process Clause prohibited California courts from asserting jurisdiction over him because he lacked ""minimum contacts"" with the State. The court held it to be ""a valid jurisdictional predicate for in personam jurisdiction"" that the ""defendant [was] present in the forum state and personally served with process."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 5. We granted certiorari. 493 U. S. 807 (1989). / II / A / The proposition that the judgment of a court lacking jurisdiction is void traces back to the English Year Books, see Bowser v. Collins, Y. B. Mich. 22 Edw. IV, f. 30, pl. 11, 145 Eng. Rep. 97 (Ex. Ch. 1482), and was made settled law by Lord Coke in Case of the Marshalsea, 10 Coke Rep. 68b, 77a, 77 Eng. Rep. 1027, 1041 (K. B. 1612). Traditionally that proposition was embodied in the phrase coram non judice, *609 ""before a person not a judge"" — meaning, in effect, that the proceeding in question was not a judicial proceeding because lawful judicial authority was not present, and could therefore not yield a judgment. American courts invalidated, or denied recognition to, judgments that violated this common-law principle long before the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. See, e. g., Grumon v. Raymond, 1 Conn. 40 (1814); Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 (No. 11,134) (CC Mass. 1828); Dunn v. Dunn, 4 Paige 425 (N. Y. Ch. 1834); Evans v. Instine, 7 Ohio 273 (1835); Steel v. Smith, 7 Watts & Serg. 447 (Pa. 1844); Boswell's Lessee v. Otis, 9 How. 336, 350 (1850). In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 732 (1878), we announced that the judgment of a court lacking personal jurisdiction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well. / To determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction is consistent with due process, we have long relied on the principles traditionally followed by American courts in marking out the territorial limits of each State's authority. That criterion was first announced in Pennoyer v. Neff, supra, in which we stated that due process ""mean[s] a course of legal proceedings according to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the protection and enforcement of private rights,"" id., at 733, including the ""well-established principles of public law respecting the jurisdiction of an independent State over persons and property,"" id., at 722. In what has become the classic expression of the criterion, we said in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), that a state court's assertion of personal jurisdiction satisfies the Due Process Clause if it does not violate "" `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' "" Id., at 316, quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940). See also Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 703 (1982). Since International Shoe, we have only been called upon to decide whether these ""traditional notions"" permit *610 States to exercise jurisdiction over absent defendants in a manner that deviates from the rules of jurisdiction applied in the 19th century. We have held such deviations permissible, but only with respect to suits arising out of the absent defendant's contacts with the State.[1] See, e. g., Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 414 (1984). The question we must decide today is whether due process requires a similar connection between the litigation and the defendant's contacts with the State in cases where the defendant is physically present in the State at the time process is served upon him. / B / Among the most firmly established principles of personal jurisdiction in American tradition is that the courts of a State have jurisdiction over nonresidents who are physically present in the State. The view developed early that each State had the power to hale before its courts any individual who could be found within its borders, and that once having acquired jurisdiction over such a person by properly serving him with process, the State could retain jurisdiction to enter *611 judgment against him, no matter how fleeting his visit. See, e. g., Potter v. Allin, 2 Root 63, 67 (Conn. 1793); Barrell v. Benjamin, 15 Mass. 354 (1819). That view had antecedents in English common-law practice, which sometimes allowed ""transitory"" actions, arising out of events outside the country, to be maintained against seemingly nonresident defendants who were present in England. See, e. g., Mostyn v. Fabrigas, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021 (K. B. 1774); Cartwright v. Pettus, 22 Eng. Rep. 916 (Ch. 1675). Justice Story believed the principle, which he traced to Roman origins, to be firmly grounded in English tradition: ""[B]y the common law[,] personal actions, being transitory, may be brought in any place, where the party defendant may be found,"" for ""every nation may . . . rightfully exercise jurisdiction over all persons within its domains."" J. Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws §§ 554, 543 (1846). See also id., §§ 530-538; Picquet v. Swan, supra, at 611-612 (Story, J.) (""Where a party is within a territory, he may justly be subjected to its process, and bound personally by the judgment pronounced, on such process, against him""). / Recent scholarship has suggested that English tradition was not as clear as Story thought, see Hazard, A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 241, 253-260; Ehrenzweig, The Transient Rule of Personal Jurisdiction: The ""Power"" Myth and Forum Conveniens, 65 Yale L. J. 289 (1956). Accurate or not, however, judging by the evidence of contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous decisions, one must conclude that Story's understanding was shared by American courts at the crucial time for present purposes: 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The following passage in a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia, in an action on a debt having no apparent relation to the defendant's temporary presence in the State, is representative: / Can a citizen of Alabama be sued in this State, as he passes through it? / *612 ""Undoubtedly he can. The second of the axioms of Huberus, as translated by Story, is: `that all persons who are found within the limits of a government, whether their residence is permanent or temporary, are to be deemed subjects thereof.' (Stor. Conf. Laws, &sec; 29, Note 3.) / "". . . [A] citizen of another State, who is merely passing through this, resides, as he passes, wherever he is. Let him be sued, therefore, wherever he may, he will be sued where he resides. / ""The plaintiff in error, although a citizen of Alabama, was passing through the County of Troup, in this State, and whilst doing so, he was sued in Troup. He was liable to be sued in this State, and in Troup County of this State."" Murphy v. J. S. Winter & Co., 18 Ga. 690, 691-692 (1855). / See also, e. g., Peabody v. Hamilton, 106 Mass. 217, 220 (1870) (relying on Story for the same principle); Alley v. Caspari, 80 Me. 234, 236-237, 14 A. 12, 13 (1888) (same). / Decisions in the courts of many States in the 19th and early 20th centuries held that personal service upon a physically present defendant sufficed to confer jurisdiction, without regard to whether the defendant was only briefly in the State or whether the cause of action was related to his activities there. See, e. g., Vinal v. Core, 18 W. Va. 1, 20 (1881); Roberts v. Dunsmuir, 75 Cal. 203, 204, 16 P. 782 (1888); De Poret v. Gusman, 30 La. Ann., pt. 2, pp. 930, 932 (1878); Smith v. Gibson, 83 Ala. 284, 285, 3 So. 321 (1887); Savin v. Bond, 57 Md. 228, 233 (1881); Hart v. Granger, 1 Conn. 154, 165 (1814); Mussina v. Belden, 6 Abb. Pr. 165, 176 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1858); Darrah v. Watson, 36 Iowa 116, 120-121 (1872); Baisley v. Baisley, 113 Mo. 544, 549-550, 21 S. W. 29, 30 (1893); Bowman v. Flint, 37 Tex. Civ. App. 28, 29, 82 S. W. 1049, 1050 (1904). See also Reed v. Hollister, 106 Ore. 407, 412-414, 212 P. 367, 369-370 (1923); Hagen v. Viney, 124 Fla. 747, 751, 169 So. 391, 392-393 (1936); Vaughn *613 v. Love, 324 Pa. 276, 280, 188 A. 299, 302 (1936).[2] Although research has not revealed a case deciding the issue in every State's courts, that appears to be because the issue was so well settled that it went unlitigated. See R. Leflar, American Conflicts Law § 24, p. 43 (1968) (""The law is so clear on this point that there are few decisions on it""); Note, Developments in the Law — State Court Jurisdiction, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 909, 937-938 (1960). Opinions from the courts of other States announced the rule in dictum. See, e. g., Reed v. Browning, 130 Ind. 575, 577, 30 N. E. 704, 705 (1892); Nathanson v. Spitz, 19 R. I. 70, 72, 31 A. 690, 691 (1895); McLeod v. Connecticut & Passumpsic River R. Co., 58 Vt. 727, 733-734, 6 A. 648, 649, 650 (1886); New Orleans J. & G. N. R. Co. v. Wallace, 50 Miss. 244, 248-249 (1874); Wagner v. Hallack, 3 Colo. 176, 182-183 (1877); Downer v. Shaw, 22 N. H. 277, 281 (1851); Moore v. Smith, 41 Ky. 340, 341 (1842); Adair County Bank v. Forrey, 74 Neb. 811, 815, 105 N. W. 714, 715-716 (1905). Most States, moreover, had statutes or common-law rules that exempted from service of process individuals who were brought into the forum by force or fraud, see, e. g., Wanzer v. Bright, 52 Ill. 35 (1869), or who were there as a party or witness in unrelated judicial proceedings, see, e. g., Burroughs v. Cocke & Willis, 56 Okla. 627, 156 P. 196 (1916); Malloy v. Brewer, 7 S. D. 587, 64 N. W. 1120 (1895). These exceptions obviously rested upon the premise that service of process conferred jurisdiction. See Anderson v. Atkins, 161 Tenn. 137, 140, 29 S. W. 2d 248, 249 (1930). Particularly striking is the fact that, as far as we have been able to determine, not one American case from the period (or, for that matter, not one American case *614 until 1978) held, or even suggested, that in-state personal service on an individual was insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.[3] Commentators were also seemingly unanimous *615 on the rule. See, e. g., 1 A. Freeman, Law of Judgments 470-471 (1873); 1 H. Black, Law of Judgments 276-277 (1891); W. Alderson, Law of Judicial Writs and Process 225-226 (1895). See also Restatement of Conflict of Laws §§ 77-78 (1934). / This American jurisdictional practice is, moreover, not merely old; it is continuing. It remains the practice of, not only a substantial number of the States, but as far as we are aware all the States and the Federal Government — if one disregards (as one must for this purpose) the few opinions since 1978 that have erroneously said, on grounds similar to those that petitioner presses here, that this Court's due process decisions render the practice unconstitutional. See Nehemiah v. Athletics Congress of U. S. A., 765 F. 2d 42, 46-47 (CA3 1985); Schreiber v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 448 F. Supp. 1079, 1088-1091 (Kan. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 611 F. 2d 790 (CA10 1979); Harold M. Pitman Co. v. Typecraft Software Ltd., 626 F. Supp. 305, 310-314 (ND Ill. 1986); Bershaw v. Sarbacher, 40 Wash. App. 653, 657, 700 P. 2d 347, 349 (1985); Duehring v. Vasquez, 490 So. 2d 667, 671 (La. App. 1986). We do not know of a single state or federal statute, or a single judicial decision resting upon state law, that has abandoned in-state service as a basis of jurisdiction. Many recent cases reaffirm it. See Hutto v. Plagens, 254 Ga. 512, *616 513, 330 S. E. 2d 341, 342 (1985); Oxmans' Erwin Meat Co. v. Blacketer, 86 Wis. 2d 683, 273 N. W. 2d 285 (1979); Lockert v.

App. 2d 228, 766 P. 2d 1291, 1292 (1989). / C / Despite this formidable body of precedent, petitioner contends, in reliance on our decisions applying the International Shoe standard, that in the absence of ""continuous and systematic"" contacts with the forum, see n. 1, supra, a nonresident defendant can be subjected to judgment only as to matters that arise out of or relate to his contacts with the forum. This argument rests on a thorough misunderstanding of our cases. / The view of most courts in the 19th century was that a court simply could not exercise in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident who had not been personally served with process in the forum. See, e. g., Reber v. Wright, 68 Pa. 471, 476-477 (1871); Sturgis v. Fay, 16 Ind. 429, 431 (1861); Weil v. Lowenthal, 10 Iowa 575, 578 (1860); Freeman, Law of Judgments, supra, at 468-470; see also D'Arcy v. Ketchum, 11 How. 165, 176 (1851); Knowles v. Gaslight & Coke Co., 19 Wall. 58, 61 (1874). Pennoyer v. Neff, while renowned for its statement of the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment *617 prohibits such an exercise of jurisdiction, in fact set that forth only as dictum and decided the case (which involved a judgment rendered more than two years before the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification) under ""well-established principles of public law."" 95 U. S., at 722. Those principles, embodied in the Due Process Clause, required (we said) that when proceedings ""involv[e] merely a determination of the personal liability of the defendant, he must be brought within [the court's] jurisdiction by service of process within the State, or his voluntary appearance."" Id., at 733. We invoked that rule in a series of subsequent cases, as either a matter of due process or a ""fundamental principl[e] of jurisprudence,"" Wilson v. Seligman, 144 U. S. 41, 46 (1892). See, e. g., New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dunlevy, 241 U. S. 518, 522-523 (1916); Goldey v. Morning News, 156 U. S. 518, 521 (1895). / Later years, however, saw the weakening of the Pennoyer rule. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, changes in the technology of transportation and communication, and the tremendous growth of interstate business activity, led to an ""inevitable relaxation of the strict limits on state jurisdiction"" over nonresident individuals and corporations. Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 260 (1958) (Black, J., dissenting). States required, for example, that nonresident corporations appoint an in-state agent upon whom process could be served as a condition of transacting business within their borders, see, e. g., St. Clair v. Cox, 106 U. S. 350 (1882), and provided in-state ""substituted service"" for nonresident motorists who caused injury in the State and left before personal service could be accomplished, see, e. g., Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U. S. 160 (1916); Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U. S. 352 (1927). We initially upheld these laws under the Due Process Clause on grounds that they complied with Pennoyer's rigid requirement of either ""consent,"" see, e. g., Hess v. Pawloski, supra, at 356, or ""presence,"" see, e. g., Philadelphia & Reading R. Co. v. McKibbin, 243 U. S. 264, 265 (1917). As many observed, *618 however, the consent and presence were purely fictional. See, e. g., 1 J. Beale, Conflict of Laws 360, 384 (1935); Hutchinson v. Chase & Gilbert, Inc., 45 F. 2d 139, 141 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.). Our opinion in International Shoe cast those fictions aside and made explicit the underlying basis of these decisions: Due process does not necessarily require the States to adhere to the unbending territorial limits on jurisdiction set forth in Pennoyer. The validity of assertion of jurisdiction over a nonconsenting defendant who is not present in the forum depends upon whether ""the quality and nature of [his] activity"" in relation to the forum, 326 U. S., at 319, renders such jurisdiction consistent with "" `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' "" Id., at 316 (citation omitted). Subsequent cases have derived from the International Shoe standard the general rule that a State may dispense with in-forum personal service on nonresident defendants in suits arising out of their activities in the State. See generally Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall, 466 U. S., at 414-415. As International Shoe suggests, the defendant's litigation-related ""minimum contacts"" may take the place of physical presence as the basis for jurisdiction: / Historically the jurisdiction of courts to render judgment in personam is grounded on their de facto power over the defendant's person. Hence his presence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court was prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment personally binding on him. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 733. But now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' "" 326 U. S., at 316 (citations omitted). / *619 Nothing in International Shoe or the cases that have followed it, however, offers support for the very different proposition petitioner seeks to establish today: that a defendant's presence in the forum is not only unnecessary to validate novel, nontraditional assertions of jurisdiction, but is itself no longer sufficient to establish jurisdiction. That proposition is unfaithful to both elementary logic and the foundations of our due process jurisprudence. The distinction between what is needed to support novel procedures and what is needed to sustain traditional ones is fundamental, as we observed over a century ago: / [A] process of law, which is not otherwise forbidden, must be taken to be due process of law, if it can show the sanction of settled usage both in England and in this country; but it by no means follows that nothing else can be due process of law. . . . [That which], in substance, has been immemorially the actual law of the land . . . therefor[e] is due process of law. But to hold that such a characteristic is essential to due process of law, would be to deny every quality of the law but its age, and to render it incapable of progress or improvement. It would be to stamp upon our jurisprudence the unchangeableness attributed to the laws of the Medes and Persians."" Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 528-529 (1884). / The short of the matter is that jurisdiction based on physical presence alone constitutes due process because it is one of the continuing traditions of our legal system that define the due process standard of ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."" That standard was developed by analogy to ""physical presence,"" and it would be perverse to say it could now be turned against that touchstone of jurisdiction. / D / Petitioner's strongest argument, though we ultimately reject it, relies upon our decision in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 *620 U. S. 186 (1977). In that case, a Delaware court hearing a shareholder's derivative suit against a corporation's directors secured jurisdiction quasi in rem by sequestering the out-of-state defendant's stock in the company, the situs of which was Delaware under Delaware law. Reasoning that Delaware's sequestration procedure was simply a mechanism to compel the absent defendants to appear in a suit to determine their personal rights and obligations, we concluded that the normal rules we had developed under International Shoe for jurisdiction over suits against absent defendants should apply — viz., Delaware could not hear the suit because the defendants' sole contact with the State (ownership of property there) was unrelated to the lawsuit. 433 U. S., at 213-215. / It goes too far to say, as petitioner contends, that Shaffer compels the conclusion that a State lacks jurisdiction over an individual unless the litigation arises out of his activities in the State. Shaffer, like International Shoe, involved jurisdiction over an absent defendant, and it stands for nothing more than the proposition that when the ""minimum contact"" that is a substitute for physical presence consists of property ownership it must, like other minimum contacts, be related to the litigation. Petitioner wrenches out of its context our statement in Shaffer that ""all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny,"" 433 U. S., at 212. When read together with the two sentences that preceded it, the meaning of this statement becomes clear: / The fiction that an assertion of jurisdiction over property is anything but an assertion of jurisdiction over the owner of the property supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification. Its continued acceptance would serve only to allow state-court jurisdiction that is fundamentally unfair to the defendant. / ""We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the *621 standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny."" Ibid. (emphasis added). / Shaffer was saying, in other words, not that all bases for the assertion of in personam jurisdiction (including, presumably, in-state service) must be treated alike and subjected to the ""minimum contacts"" analysis of International Shoe; but rather that quasi in rem jurisdiction, that fictional ""ancient form,"" and in personam jurisdiction, are really one and the same and must be treated alike — leading to the conclusion that quasi in rem jurisdiction, i. e., that form of in personam jurisdiction based upon a ""property ownership"" contact and by definition unaccompanied by personal, in-state service, must satisfy the litigation-relatedness requirement of International Shoe. The logic of Shaffer's holding — which places all suits against absent nonresidents on the same constitutional footing, regardless of whether a separate Latin label is attached to one particular basis of contact — does not compel the conclusion that physically present defendants must be treated identically to absent ones. As we have demonstrated at length, our tradition has treated the two classes of defendants quite differently, and it is unreasonable to read Shaffer as casually obliterating that distinction. International Shoe confined its ""minimum contacts"" requirement to situations in which the defendant ""be not present within the territory of the forum,"" 326 U. S., at 316, and nothing in Shaffer expands that requirement beyond that. / It is fair to say, however, that while our holding today does not contradict Shaffer, our basic approach to the due process question is different. We have conducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or fairness of the prevailing instate service rule, leaving that judgment to the legislatures that are free to amend it; for our purposes, its validation is its pedigree, as the phrase ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"" makes clear. Shaffer did conduct such an independent inquiry, asserting that "" `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice' can be as readily offended *622 by the perpetuation of ancient forms that are no longer justified as by the adoption of new procedures that are inconsistent with the basic values of our constitutional heritage."" 433 U. S., at 212. Perhaps that assertion can be sustained when the ""perpetuation of ancient forms"" is engaged in by only a very small minority of the States.[4] Where, however, as in the present case, a jurisdictional principle is both firmly approved by tradition and still favored, it is impossible to imagine what standard we could appeal to for the judgment that it is ""no longer justified."" While in no way receding from or casting doubt upon the holding of Shaffer or any other case, we reaffirm today our time-honored approach, see, e. g., Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U. S. 94, 110-112 (1921); Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S., at 528-529; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 59 U. S. 272, 276-277 (1856). For new procedures, hitherto unknown, the Due Process clause requires analysis to determine whether ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"" have been offended. International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316. But a doctrine of personal jurisdiction that dates back to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and is still generally observed unquestionably meets that standard. / III / A few words in response to JUSTICE BRENNAN's opinion concurring in the judgment: It insists that we apply ""contemporary notions of due process"" to determine the constitutionality of California's assertion of jurisdiction. Post, at 632. But our analysis today comports with that prescription, at least if we give it the only sense allowed by our precedents. The ""contemporary notions of due process"" applicable to personal *623 jurisdiction are the enduring ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"" established as the test by International Shoe. By its very language, that test is satisfied if a state court adheres to jurisdictional rules that are generally applied and have always been applied in the United States. / But the concurrence's proposed standard of ""contemporary notions of due process"" requires more: It measures state-court jurisdiction not only against traditional doctrines in this country, including current state-court practice, but also against each Justice's subjective assessment of what is fair and just. Authority for that seductive standard is not to be found in any of our personal jurisdiction cases. It is, indeed, an outright break with the test of ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,"" which would have to be reformulated ""our notions of fair play and substantial justice."" / The subjectivity, and hence inadequacy, of this approach becomes apparent when the concurrence tries to explain why the assertion of jurisdiction in the present case meets its standard of continuing-American-tradition-plus-innate-fairness. JUSTICE BRENNAN lists the ""benefits"" Mr. Burnham derived from the State of California — the fact that, during the few days he was there, ""[h]is health and safety [were] guaranteed by the State's police, fire, and emergency medical services; he [was] free to travel on the State's roads and waterways; he likely enjoy[ed] the fruits of the State's economy."" Post, at 637-638. Three days' worth of these benefits strike us as powerfully inadequate to establish, as an abstract matter, that it is ""fair"" for California to decree the ownership of all Mr. Burnham's worldly goods acquired during the 10 years of his marriage, and the custody over his children. We daresay a contractual exchange swapping those benefits for that power would not survive the ""unconscionability"" provision of the Uniform Commercial Code. Even less persuasive are the other ""fairness"" factors alluded to by JUSTICE BRENNAN. It would create ""an asymmetry,"" we are told, if Burnham were permitted (as he is) to appear *624 in California courts as a plaintiff, but were not compelled to appear in California courts as defendant; and travel being as easy as it is nowadays, and modern procedural devices being so convenient, it is no great hardship to appear in California courts. Post, at 638-639. The problem with these assertions is that they justify the exercise of jurisdiction over everyone, whether or not he ever comes to California. The only ""fairness"" elements setting Mr. Burnham apart from the rest of the world are the three days' ""benefits"" referred to above — and even those, do not set him apart from many other people who have enjoyed three days in the Golden State (savoring the fruits of its economy, the availability of its roads and police services) but who were fortunate enough not to be served with process while they were there and thus are not (simply by reason of that savoring) subject to the general jurisdiction of California's courts. See, e. g., Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall, 466 U. S., at 414-416. In other words, even if one agreed with JUSTICE BRENNAN's conception of an equitable bargain, the ""benefits"" we have been discussing would explain why it is ""fair"" to assert general jurisdiction over Burnham-returned-to-New-Jersey-after-service only at the expense of proving that it is also ""fair"" to assert general jurisdiction over Burnham-returned-to-New-Jersey-without-service — which we know does not conform with ""contemporary notions of due process."" / There is, we must acknowledge, one factor mentioned by JUSTICE BRENNAN that both relates distinctively to the assertion of jurisdiction on the basis of personal in-state service and is fully persuasive — namely, the fact that a defendant voluntarily present in a particular State has a ""reasonable expectatio[n]"" that he is subject to suit there. Post, at 637. By formulating it as a ""reasonable expectation"" JUSTICE BRENNAN makes that seem like a ""fairness"" factor; but in reality, of course, it is just tradition masquerading as ""fairness."" The only reason for charging Mr. Burnham with the reasonable expectation of being subject to suit is that the *625 States of the Union assert adjudicatory jurisdiction over the person, and have always asserted adjudicatory jurisdiction over the person, by serving him with process during his temporary physical presence in their territory. That continuing tradition, which anyone entering California should have known about, renders it ""fair"" for Mr. Burnham, who voluntarily entered California, to be sued there for divorce — at least ""fair"" in the limited sense that he has no one but himself to blame. JUSTICE BRENNAN's long journey is a circular one, leaving him, at the end of the day, in complete reliance upon the very factor he sought to avoid: The existence of a continuing tradition is not enough, fairness also must be considered; fairness exists here because there is a continuing tradition. / While JUSTICE BRENNAN's concurrence is unwilling to confess that the Justices of this Court can possibly be bound by a continuing American tradition that a particular procedure is fair, neither is it willing to embrace the logical consequences of that refusal — or even to be clear about what consequences (logical or otherwise) it does embrace. JUSTICE BRENNAN says that ""[f]or these reasons [i. e., because of the reasonableness factors enumerated above], as a rule the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant based on his voluntary presence in the forum will satisfy the requirements of due process."" Post, at 639. The use of the word ""rule"" conveys the reassuring feeling that he is establishing a principle of law one can rely upon — but of course he is not. Since JUSTICE BRENNAN's only criterion of constitutionality is ""fairness,"" the phrase ""as a rule"" represents nothing more than his estimation that, usually, all the elements of ""fairness"" he discusses in the present case will exist. But what if they do not? Suppose, for example, that a defendant in Mr. Burnham's situation enjoys not three days' worth of California's ""benefits,"" but 15 minutes' worth. Or suppose we remove one of those ""benefits"" — ""enjoy[ment of] the fruits of the State's economy"" — by positing that Mr. Burnham had not *626 come to California on business, but only to visit his children. Or suppose that Mr. Burnham were demonstrably so impecunious as to be unable to take advantage of the modern means of transportation and communication that JUSTICE BRENNAN finds so relevant. Or suppose, finally, that the California courts lacked the ""variety of procedural devices,"" post, at 639, that JUSTICE BRENNAN says can reduce the burden upon out-of-state litigants. One may also make additional suppositions, relating not to the absence of the factors that JUSTICE BRENNAN discusses, but to the presence of additional factors bearing upon the ultimate criterion of ""fairness."" What if, for example, Mr. Burnham were visiting a sick child? Or a dying child? Cf. Kulko v. Superior Court of California, City and County of San Francisco, 436 U. S. 84, 93 (1978) (finding the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction over an absent parent unreasonable because it would ""discourage parents from entering into reasonable visitation agreements""). Since, so far as one can tell, JUSTICE BRENNAN's approval of applying the in-state service rule in the present case rests on the presence of all the factors he lists, and on the absence of any others, every different case will present a different litigable issue. Thus, despite the fact that he manages to work the word ""rule"" into his formulation, JUSTICE BRENNAN's approach does not establish a rule of law at all, but only a ""totality of the circumstances"" test, guaranteeing what traditional territorial rules of jurisdiction were designed precisely to avoid: uncertainty and litigation over the preliminary issue of the forum's competence. It may be that those evils, necessarily accompanying a freestanding ""reasonableness"" inquiry, must be accepted at the margins, when we evaluate nontraditional forms of jurisdiction newly adopted by the States, see, e. g., Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of California, Solano County, 480 U. S. 102, 115 (1987). But that is no reason for injecting them into the core of our American practice, exposing to such a ""reasonableness"" inquiry the ground of jurisdiction that has hitherto *627 been considered the very baseline of reasonableness, physical presence. / The difference between us and JUSTICE BRENNAN has nothing to do with whether ""further progress [is] to be made"" in the ""evolution of our legal system."" Post, at 631, n. 3. It has to do with whether changes are to be adopted as progressive by the American people or decreed as progressive by the Justices of this Court. Nothing we say today prevents individual States from limiting or entirely abandoning the in-state-service basis of jurisdiction. And nothing prevents an overwhelming majority of them from doing so, with the consequence that the ""traditional notions of fairness"" that this Court applies may change. But the States have overwhelmingly declined to adopt such limitation or abandonment, evidently not considering it to be progress.[5] The question is whether, armed with no authority other than individual Justices' perceptions of fairness that conflict with both past and current practice, this Court can compel the States to make such a change on the ground that ""due process"" requires it. We hold that it cannot. / * * * / *628 Because the Due Process Clause does not prohibit the California courts from exercising jurisdiction over petitioner based on the fact of in-state service of process, the judgment is / Affirmed. / JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. / I join Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion and concur in the judgment of affirmance. The rule allowing jurisdiction to be obtained over a nonresident by personal service in the forum State, without more, has been and is so widely accepted throughout this country that I could not possibly strike it down, either on its face or as applied in this case, on the ground that it denies due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the Court has the authority under the Amendment to examine even traditionally accepted procedures and declare them invalid, e. g., Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186 (1977), there has been no showing here or elsewhere that as a general proposition the rule is so arbitrary and lacking in common sense in so many instances that it should be held violative of due process in every case. Furthermore, until such a showing is made, which would be difficult indeed, claims in individual cases that the rule would operate unfairly as applied to the particular nonresident involved need not be entertained. At least this would be the case where presence in the forum State is intentional, which would almost always be the fact. Otherwise, there would be endless, fact-specific litigation in the trial and appellate courts, including this one. Here, personal service in California, without more, is enough, and I agree that the judgment should be affirmed. / JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, concurring in the judgment. / I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally permits a state *629 court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if he is served with process while voluntarily present in the forum State.[1] I do not perceive the need, however, to decide that a jurisdictional rule that "" `has been immemorially the actual law of the land,' "" ante, at 619, quoting Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 528 (1884), automatically comports with due process simply by virtue of its ""pedigree."" Although I agree that history is an important factor in establishing whether a jurisdictional rule satisfies due process requirements, I cannot agree that it is the only factor such that all traditional rules of jurisdiction are, ipso facto, forever constitutional. Unlike JUSTICE SCALIA, I would undertake an ""independent inquiry into the . . . fairness of the prevailing in-state service rule."" Ante, at 621. I therefore concur only in the judgment. / I / I believe that the approach adopted by JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion today — reliance solely on historical pedigree — is foreclosed by our decisions in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), and Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186 (1977). In International Shoe, we held that a state court's assertion of personal jurisdiction does not violate the Due Process Clause if it is consistent with "" `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' "" 326 U. S., at 316, quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940).[2] In Shaffer, we stated that ""all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny."" 433 *630 U. S., at 212 (emphasis added). The critical insight of Shaffer is that all rules of jurisdiction, even ancient ones, must satisfy contemporary notions of due process. No longer were we content to limit our jurisdictional analysis to pronouncements that ""[t]he foundation of jurisdiction is physical power,"" McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U. S. 90, 91 (1917), and that ""every State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory."" Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 722 (1878). While acknowledging that ""history must be considered as supporting the proposition that jurisdiction based solely on the presence of property satisfied[d] the demands of due process,"" we found that this factor could not be ""decisive."" 433 U. S., at 211-212. We recognized that "" `[t]raditional notions of fair play and substantial justice' can be as readily offended by the perpetuation of ancient forms that are no longer justified as by the adoption of new procedures that are inconsistent with the basic values of our constitutional heritage."" Id., at 212 (citations omitted). I agree with this approach and continue to believe that ""the minimum-contacts analysis developed in International Shoe . . . represents a far more sensible construct for the exercise of state-court jurisdiction than the patchwork of legal and factual fictions that has been generated from the decision in Pennoyer v. Neff."" Id., at 219 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation omitted). / While our holding in Shaffer may have been limited to quasi in rem jurisdiction, our mode of analysis was not. Indeed, that we were willing in Shaffer to examine anew the appropriateness of the quasi in rem rule — until that time dutifully accepted by American courts for at least a century — demonstrates that we did not believe that the ""pedigree"" of a jurisdictional practice was dispositive in deciding whether it was consistent with due process. We later characterized Shaffer as ""abandon[ing] the outworn rule of Harris v. Balk, 198 U. S. 215 (1905), that the interest of a creditor in a debt *631 could be extinguished or otherwise affected by any State having transitory jurisdiction over the debtor."" World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 296 (1980); see also Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U. S. 320, 325-326 (1980). If we could discard an ""ancient form without substantial modern justification"" in Shaffer, supra, at 212, we can do so again.[3] Lower courts,[4] commentators,[5] and the American Law Institute[6] *632 all have interpreted International Shoe and Shaffer to mean that every assertion of state-court jurisdiction, even one pursuant to a ""traditional"" rule such as transient jurisdiction, must comport with contemporary notions of due process. Notwithstanding the nimble gymnastics of JUSTICE *633 SCALIA's opinion today, it is not faithful to our decision in Shaffer. / II / Tradition, though alone not dispositive, is of course relevant to the question whether the rule of transient jurisdiction is consistent with due process.[7] Tradition is salient not in the sense that practices of the past are automatically reasonable today; indeed, under such a standard, the legitimacy of transient jurisdiction would be called into question because the rule's historical ""pedigree"" is a matter of intense debate. The rule was a stranger to the common law[8] and was rather *634 weakly implanted in American jurisprudence ""at the crucial time for present purposes: 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted."" Ante, at 611. For much of the 19th century, American courts did not uniformly recognize the concept of transient jurisdiction,[9] and it appears that the *635 transient rule did not receive wide currency until well after our decision in Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 (1878).[10] / Rather, I find the historical background relevant because, however murky the jurisprudential origins of transient jurisdiction, *636 the fact that American courts have announced the rule for perhaps a century (first in dicta, more recently in holdings) provides a defendant voluntarily present in a particular State today ""clear notice that [he] is subject to suit"" in *637 the forum. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S., at 297. Regardless of whether Justice Story's account of the rule's genesis is mythical, our common understanding now, fortified by a century of judicial practice, is that jurisdiction is often a function of geography. The transient rule is consistent with reasonable expectations and is entitled to a strong presumption that it comports with due process. ""If I visit another State, . . . I knowingly assume some risk that the State will exercise its power over my property or my person while there. My contact with the State, though minimal, gives rise to predictable risks."" Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 218 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); see also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476 (1985) (""[T]erritorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant's affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there""); Glen, An Analysis of ""Mere Presence"" and Other Traditional Bases of Jurisdiction, 45 Brooklyn L. Rev. 607, 611-612 (1979). Thus, proposed revisions to the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 28, p. 39 (1986), provide that ""[a] state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over an individual who is present within its territory unless the individual's relationship to the state is so attenuated as to make the exercise of such jurisdiction unreasonable.""[11] / By visiting the forum State, a transient defendant actually ""avail[s]"" himself, Burger King, supra, at 476, of significant benefits provided by the State. His health and safety are guaranteed by the State's police, fire, and emergency medical services; he is free to travel on the State's roads and water-ways; *638 he likely enjoys the fruits of the State's economy as well. Moreover, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV prevents a state government from discriminating against a transient defendant by denying him the protections of its law or the right of access to its courts.[12] See Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper, 470 U. S. 274, 281, n. 10 (1985); Baldwin v. Montana Fish and Game Comm'n, 436 U. S. 371, 387 (1978); see also Supreme Court of Virginia v. Friedman, 487 U. S. 59, 64-65 (1988). Subject only to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, an out-of-state plaintiff may use state courts in all circumstances in which those courts would be available to state citizens. Without transient jurisdiction, an asymmetry would arise: A transient would have the full benefit of the power of the forum State's courts as a plaintiff while retaining immunity from their authority as a defendant. See Maltz, Sovereign Authority, Fairness, and Personal Jurisdiction: The Case for the Doctrine of Transient Jurisdiction, 66 Wash. U. L. Q. 671, 698-699 (1988). / The potential burdens on a transient defendant are slight. "" `[M]odern transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself' "" in a State outside his place of residence. Burger King, supra, at 474, quoting McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U. S. 220, 223 (1957). That the defendant has already journeyed *639 at least once before to the forum — as evidenced by the fact that he was served with process there — is an indication that suit in the forum likely would not be prohibitively inconvenient. Finally, any burdens that do arise can be ameliorated by a variety of procedural devices.[13] For these reasons, as a rule the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant based on his voluntary presence in the forum will satisfy the requirements of due process.[14] See n. 11, supra. / *640 In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner was served with process while voluntarily and knowingly in the State of California. I therefore concur in the judgment. / JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in the judgment. / As I explained in my separate writing, I did not join the Court's opinion in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186 (1977), because I was concerned by its unnecessarily broad reach. Id., at 217-219 (opinion concurring in judgment). The same concern prevents me from joining either JUSTICE SCALIA's or JUSTICE BRENNAN's opinion in this case. For me, it is sufficient to note that the historical evidence and consensus identified by JUSTICE SCALIA, the considerations of fairness identified by JUSTICE BRENNAN, and the common sense displayed by JUSTICE WHITE, all combine to demonstrate that this is, indeed, a very easy case.[*] / Accordingly, I agree that the judgment should be affirmed. / FOOTNOTES / [1] We have said that ""[e]ven when the cause of action does not arise out of or relate to the foreign corporation's activities in the forum State, due process is not offended by a State's subjecting the corporation to its in personam jurisdiction when there are sufficient contacts between the State and the foreign corporation."" Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall, 466 U. S., at 414. Our only holding supporting that statement, however, involved ""regular service of summons upon [the corporation's] president while he was in [the forum State] acting in that capacity."" See Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, 440 (1952). It may be that whatever special rule exists permitting ""continuous and systematic"" contacts, id., at 438, to support jurisdiction with respect to matters unrelated to activity in the forum applies only to corporations, which have never fitted comfortably in a jurisdictional regime based primarily upon ""de facto power over the defendant's person."" International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945). We express no views on these matters — and, for simplicity's sake, omit reference to this aspect of ""contacts""-based jurisdiction in our discussion. / [2] JUSTICE BRENNAN's assertion that some of these cases involved dicta rather than holdings, post, at 636-637, n. 10, is incorrect. In each case, personal service within the State was the exclusive basis for the judgment that jurisdiction existed, and no other factor was relied upon. Nor is it relevant for present purposes that these holdings might instead have been rested on other available grounds. / [3] Given this striking fact, and the unanimity of both cases and commentators in supporting the in-state service rule, one can only marvel at JUSTICE BRENNAN's assertion that the rule ""was rather weakly implanted in American jurisprudence,"" post, at 633-634, and ""did not receive wide currency until well after our decision in Pennoyer v. Neff,"" post, at 635. I have cited pre-Pennoyer cases clearly supporting the rule from no less than nine States, ranging from Mississippi to Colorado to New Hampshire, and two highly respected pre-Pennoyer commentators. (It is, moreover, impossible to believe that the many other cases decided shortly after Pennoyer represented some sort of instant mutation — or, for that matter, that Pennoyer itself was not drawing upon clear contemporary understanding.) JUSTICE BRENNAN cites neither cases nor commentators from the relevant period to support his thesis (with exceptions I shall discuss presently), and instead relies upon modern secondary sources that do not mention, and were perhaps unaware of, many of the materials I have discussed. The cases cited by JUSTICE BRENNAN, post, at 634-635, n. 9, do not remotely support his point. The dictum he quotes from Coleman's Appeal, 75 Pa. 441, 458 (1874), to the effect that ""a man shall only be liable to be called on to answer for civil wrongs in the forum of his home, and the tribunal of his vicinage,"" was addressing the situation where no personal service in the State had been obtained. This is clear from the court's earlier statements that ""there is no mode of reaching by any process issuing from a court of common law, the person of a non-resident defendant not found within the jurisdiction,"" id., at 456, and ""[u]pon a summons, unless there is service within the jurisdiction, there can be no judgment for want of appearance against the defendant."" Ibid. Gardner v. Thomas, 14 Johns. *134 (N. Y. 1817), and Molony v. Dows, 8 Abb. Pr. 316 (N. Y. Common Pleas 1859), are irrelevant to the present discussion. Gardner, in which the court declined to adjudicate a tort action between two British subjects for a tort that occurred on the high seas aboard a British vessel, specifically affirmed that jurisdiction did exist, but said that its exercise ""must, on principles of policy, often rest in the sound discretion of the Court."" Gardner v. Thomas, supra, at *137-*138. The decision is plainly based, in modern terms, upon the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Molony did indeed hold that in-state service could not support the adjudication of an action for physical assault by one Californian against another in California (acknowledging that this appeared to contradict an earlier New York case), but it rested that holding upon a doctrine akin to the principle that no State will enforce the penal laws of another — that is, resting upon the injury to the public peace of the other State that such an assault entails, and upon the fact that the damages awarded include penal elements. Molony v. Dows, supra, at 330. The fairness or propriety of exercising jurisdiction over the parties had nothing to do with the decision, as is evident from the court's acknowledgment that if the Californians were suing one another over a contract dispute jurisdiction would lie, no matter where the contract arose. 8 Abb. Pr., at 328. As for JUSTICE BRENNAN's citation of the 1880 commentator John Cleland Wells, post, at 635, n. 9, it suffices to quote what is set forth on the very page cited: ""It is held to be a principle of the common law that any non-resident defendant voluntarily coming within the jurisdiction may be served with process, and compelled to answer."" 1 J. Wells, Jurisdiction of Courts 76 (1880). / [4] Shaffer may have involved a unique state procedure in one respect: JUSTICE STEVENS noted that Delaware was the only State that treated the place of incorporation as the situs of corporate stock when both owner and custodian were elsewhere. See 433 U. S., at 218 (opinion concurring in judgment). / [5] I find quite unacceptable as a basis for this Court's decisions JUSTICE BRENNAN's view that ""the raison d'etre of various constitutional doctrines designed to protect out-of-states, such as the Art. IV Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Commerce Clause,"" post, at 640, n. 14, entitles this Court to brand as ""unfair,"" and hence unconstitutional, the refusal of all 50 States ""to limit or abandon bases of jurisdiction that have become obsolete,"" post, at 639, n. 14. ""Due process"" (which is the constitutional text at issue here) does not mean that process which shifting majorities of this Court feel to be ""due""; but that process which American society — self-interested American society, which expresses its judgments in the laws of self-interested States — has traditionally considered ""due."" The notion that the Constitution, through some penumbra emanating from the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Commerce Clause, establishes this Court as a Platonic check upon the society's greedy adherence to its traditions can only be described as imperious. / BRENNAN CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES / [1] I use the term ""transient jurisdiction"" to refer to jurisdiction premised solely on the fact that a person is served with process while physically present in the forum State. / [2] Our reference in International Shoe to "" `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,' "" 326 U. S., at 316, meant simply that those concepts are indeed traditional ones, not that, as JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion suggests, see ante, at 621, 622, their specific content was to be determined by tradition alone. We recognized that contemporary societal norms must play a role in our analysis. See, e. g., 326 U. S., at 317 (considerations of ""reasonable[ness], in the context of our federal system of government""). / [3] Even JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion concedes that sometimes courts may discard ""traditional"" rules when they no longer comport with contemporary notions of due process. For example, although, beginning with the Romans, judicial tribunals for over a millenium permitted jurisdiction to be acquired by force, see L. Wenger, Institutes of the Roman Law of Civil Procedure 46-47 (O. Fisk trans., rev. ed. 1986), by the 19th century, as JUSTICE SCALIA acknowledges, this method had largely disappeared. See ante, at 613. I do not see why JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion assumes that there is no further progress to be made and that the evolution of our legal system, and the society in which it operates, ended 100 years ago. / [4] Some lower courts have concluded that transient jurisdiction did not survive Shaffer. See Nehemiah v. Athletics Congress of U. S. A., 765 F. 2d 42, 46-47 (CA3 1985); Schreiber v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 448 F. Supp. 1079, 1088-1091 (Kan. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 611 F. 2d 790 (CA10 1979); Harold M. Pitman Co. v. Typecraft Software Ltd., 626 F. Supp. 305, 310-314 (ND Ill. 1986); Bershaw v. Sarbacher, 40 Wash. App. 653, 657, 700 P. 2d 347, 349 (1985). Others have held that transient jurisdiction is alive and well. See ante, at 615-616. But even cases falling into the latter category have engaged in the type of due process analysis that JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion claims is unnecessary today. See, e. g., Amusement Equipment, Inc. v. Mordelt, 779 F. 2d 264, 270 (CA5 1985); Hutto v. Plagens, 254 Ga. 512, 513, 330 S. E. 2d 341, 342 (1985); In re Marriage of Pridemore, 146 Ill. App. 3d 990, 992, 497 N. E. 2d 818, 819-820 (1986); Oxmans' Erwin Meat Co. v. Blacketer, 86 Wis. 2d 683, 688-692, 273 N. W. 2d 285, 287-290 (1979); Lockert v. Breedlove, 321 N. C. 66, 71-72, 361 S.

E. 2d 190, 192, and n. 5 (1988). / [5] Although commentators have disagreed over whether the rule of transient jurisdiction is consistent with modern conceptions of due process, that they have engaged in such a debate at all shows that they have rejected the methodology employed by JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion today.

This principle is that a state does not have jurisdiction in the absence of some reasonable basis for exercising it. With respect to judicial jurisdiction, this principle was laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in International Shoe . . . .""); id., at 30 (""Three factors are primarily responsible for existing rules of judicial jurisdiction. Present-day notions of fair play and substantial justice constitute the first factor""); id., § 28, Comment b, at 41, (""The Supreme Court held in Shaffer v. Heitner that the presence of a thing in a state gives that state jurisdiction to determine interests in the thing only in situations where the exercise of such jurisdiction would be reasonable. . . . It must likewise follow that considerations of reasonableness qualify the power of a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over an individual on the basis of his physical presence within its territory""); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 8, Comment a, p. 64 (Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 10, 1978) (Shaffer establishes "" `minimum contacts' in place of presence as the principal basis for territorial jurisdiction""). / [7] I do not propose that the ""contemporary notions of due process"" to be applied are no more than ""each Justice's subjective assessment of what is fair and just."" Ante, at 623. Rather, the inquiry is guided by our decisions beginning with International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), and the specific factors that we have developed to ascertain whether a jurisdictional rule comports with ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."" See, e. g., Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of California, Solano County, 480 U. S. 102, 113 (1987) (noting ""several factors,"" including ""the burden on the defendant, the interests of the forum State, and the plaintiff's interest in obtaining relief""). This analysis may not be ""mechanical or quantitative,"" International Shoe, supra, at 319, but neither is it ""freestanding,"" ante, at 626, or dependent on personal whim. Our experience with this approach demonstrates that it is well within our competence to employ. / [8] As JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion acknowledges, American courts in the 19th century erected the theory of transient jurisdiction largely upon Justice Story's historical interpretation of Roman and continental sources. JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion concedes that the rule's tradition ""was not as clear as Story thought,"" ante, at 611; in fact, it now appears that as a historical matter Story was almost surely wrong. See Ehrenzweig, The Transient Rule of Personal Jurisdiction: The ""Power"" Myth and Forum Conveniens, 65 Yale L. J. 289, 293-303 (1956); Hazard, A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 241, 261 (""Story's system reflected neither decided authority nor critical analysis""). Undeniably, Story's views are in considerable tension with English common law — a ""tradition"" closer to our own and thus, I would imagine, one that in JUSTICE SCALIA's eyes is more deserving of our study than civil law practice. See R. Boote, An Historical Treatise of an Action or Suit at Law 97 (3d ed. 1805); G. Cheshire, Private International Law 601 (4th ed. 1952); J. Westlake, Private International Law 101-102 (1859); Note, British Precedents for Due Process Limitations on In Personam Jurisdiction, 48 Colum. L. Rev. 605, 610-611 (1948) (""The [British] cases evidence a judicial intent to limit the rules to those instances where their application is consonant with the demands of `fair play' and `substantial justice' "") / It seems that Justice Story's interpretation of historical practice amounts to little more than what Justice Story himself perceived to be ""fair and just."" See ante, at 611 (quoting Justice Story's statement that "" `[w]here a party is within a territory, he may justly be subjected to its process' "") (emphasis added and citation omitted). I see no reason to bind ourselves forever to that perception. / [9] In Molony v. Dows, 8 Abb. Pr. 316 (N. Y. Common Pleas 1859), for example, the court dismissed an action for a tort that had occurred in California, even though the defendant was served with process while he was in the forum State of New York. The court rejected the plaintiff's contention that it possessed ""jurisdiction of all actions, local and transitory, where the defendant resides, or is personally served with process,"" id., at 325, with the comment that ""an action cannot be maintained in this court, or in any court of this State, to recover a pecuniary satisfaction in damages for a wilful injury to the person, inflicted in another State, where, at the time of the act, both the wrongdoer and the party injured were domiciled in that State as resident citizens."" Id., at 326. The court reasoned that it could not ""undertake to redress every wrong that may have happened in any part of the world, [merely] because the parties, plaintiff or defendant, may afterwards happen to be within [the court's] jurisdiction."" Id., at 327-328. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared it ""the most important principle of all municipal law of Anglo-Saxon origin, that a man shall only be liable to be called upon to answer for civil wrongs in the forum of his home, and the tribunal of his vicinage."" Coleman's Appeal, 75 Pa. 441, 458 (1874) (emphasis added). And in Gardner v. Thomas, 14 Johns. *134 (N. Y. 1817), the court was faced with the question ""whether this Court will take cognizance of a tort committed on the high seas, on board of a foreign vessel, both the parties being subjects or citizens of the country to which the vessel belongs,"" after the ship had docked in New York and suit was commenced there. The court observed that Lord Mansfield had appeared ""to doubt whether an action may be maintained in England for an injury in consequence of two persons fighting in France, [even] when both are within the jurisdiction of the Court."" Id., at *137. The court distinguished the instant case as an action ""for an injury on the high seas"" — a location, ""of course, without the actual or exclusive territory of any nation."" Ibid. Nevertheless, the court found that while ""our Courts may take cognizance of torts committed on the high seas, on board of a foreign vessel where both parties are foreigners, . . . it must, on principles of policy, often rest in the sound discretion of the Court to afford jurisdiction or not, according to the circumstances of the case."" Id., at *137-*138. In the particular case before it, the court found jurisdiction lacking. See id., at *138. See also 1 J. Wells, Jurisdiction of Courts 76 (1880) (reporting that a state court had argued that ""courts have jurisdiction of actions for torts as to property, even where the parties are non-resident, and the torts were committed out of the state, if the defendant is served with process within the state,"" but also noting that ""Clerke, J., very vigorously dissented in the case, and, I judge, with good reason""). / It is possible to distinguish these cases narrowly on their facts, as JUSTICE SCALIA demonstrates. See ante, at 614-615, n. 3. Thus, Molony could be characterized as a case about the reluctance of one State to punish assaults occurring in another, Gardner as a forum non conveniens case, and Coleman's Appeal as a case in which there was no in-state service of process. But such an approach would mistake the trees for the forest. The truth is that the transient rule as we now conceive it had no clear counterpart at common law. Just as today there is an interaction among rules governing jurisdiction, forum non conveniens, and choice of law, see, e. g., Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U. S. 516, 530-531 (1990); Shaffer, 433 U. S. 186, 224-226 (1977) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 256 (1958) (Black, J., dissenting), at common law there was a complex interplay among pleading requirements, venue, and substantive law — an interplay which in large part substituted for a theory of ""jurisdiction"": / ""A theory of territorial jurisdiction would in any event have been premature in England before, say, 1688, or perhaps even 1832. Problems of jurisdiction were the essence of medieval English law and remained significant until the period of Victorian reform. But until after 1800 it would have been impossible, even if it had been thought appropriate, to disentangle the question of territorial limitations on jurisdiction from those arising out of charter, prerogative, personal privilege, corporate liberty, ancient custom, and the fortuities of rules of pleading, venue, and process. The intricacies of English jurisdictional law of that time resist generalization on any theory except a franchisal one; they seem certainly not reducible to territorial dimension. / ""The English precedents on jurisdiction were therefore of little relevance to American problems of the nineteenth century."" Hazard, A General Theory of State-Court Jurisdiction, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 241, 252-253 (footnote omitted). / See also Twitchell, The Myth of General Jurisdiction, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 610, 617 (1988). The salient point is that many American courts followed English precedents and restricted the place where certain actions could be brought, regardless of the defendant's presence or whether he was served there. / [10] One distinguished legal historian has observed that ""notwithstanding dogmatic generalizations later sanctioned by the Restatement [of Conflict of Laws], appellate courts hardly ever in fact held transient service sufficient as such"" and that ""although the transient rule has often been mouthed by the courts, it has but rarely been applied."" Ehrenzweig, 65 Yale L. J., at 292, 295 (footnote omitted). Many of the cases cited in JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion, see ante, at 612-613, involve either announcement of the rule in dictum or situations where factors other than in-state service supported the exercise of jurisdiction. See, e. g., Alley v. Caspari, 80 Me. 234, 236, 14 A. 12 (1888) (defendant found to be resident of forum); De Poret v. Gusman, 30 La. Ann., pt. 2, 930, 932 (1878) (cause of action arose in forum): Savin v. Bond, 57 Md. 228, 233 (1881) (both defendants residents of forum State); Hart v. Granger, 1 Conn. 154, 154-155 (1814) (suit brought against former resident of forum State based on contract entered into there); Baisley v. Baisley, 113 Mo. 544, 550, 21 S. W. 29, 30 (1893) (court ruled for plaintiff on grounds of estoppel because defendant had failed to raise timely objection to jurisdiction in a prior suit); Bowman v. Flint, 37 Tex. Civ. App. 28, 28-29, 82 S. W. 1049, 1049-1050 (1904) (defendant did business within forum State, and cause of action arose there as well). In Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 (No. 11,134) (CC Mass. 1828), Justice Story found jurisdiction to be lacking over a suit by a French citizen (a resident of Paris) against an American citizen also residing in Paris. See also Hazard, supra, at 261 (criticizing Story's reasoning in Picquet as ""at variance"" with both American and English decisions). / [11] As the Restatement suggests, there may be cases in which a defendant's involuntary or unknowing presence in a State does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over him. The facts of the instant case do not require us to determine the outer limits of the transient jurisdiction rule. / [12] That these privileges may independently be required by the Constitution does not mean that they must be ignored for purposes of determining the fairness of the transient jurisdiction rule. For example, in the context of specific jurisdiction, we consider whether a defendant ""has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business"" in the forum State, Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476 (1985), or has "" `invok[ed] the benefits and protections of its laws,' "" id., at 475, quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S., at 253, even though the State could not deny the defendant the right to do so. See also Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of California, Solano County, 480 U. S., at 108-109 (plurality opinion); Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 781 (1984); World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 297 (1980). / [13] For example, in the federal system, a transient defendant can avoid protracted litigation of a spurious suit through a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or through a motion for summary judgment. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6) and 56. He can use relatively inexpensive methods of discovery, such as oral deposition by telephone (Rule 30(b)(7)), deposition upon written questions (Rule 31), interrogatories (Rule 33), and requests for admission (Rule 36), while enjoying protection from harassment (Rule 26(c)), and possibly obtaining costs and attorney's fees for some of the work involved (Rules 37(a)(4), (b)-(d)). Moreover, a change of venue may be possible. 28 U. S. C. § 1404. In state court, many of the same procedural protections are available, as is the doctrine of forum non conveniens, under which the suit may be dismissed. See generally Abrams, Power, Convenience, and the Elimination of Personal Jurisdiction in the Federal Courts, 58 Ind. L. J. 1, 23-25 (1982). / [14] JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion maintains that, viewing transient jurisdiction as a contractual bargain, the rule is ""unconscionabl[e],"" ante, at 623, according to contemporary conceptions of fairness. But the opinion simultaneously insists that because of its historical ""pedigree,"" the rule is ""the very baseline of reasonableness."" Ante, at 627. Thus is revealed JUSTICE SCALIA's belief that tradition alone is completely dispositive and that no showing of unfairness can ever serve to invalidate a traditional jurisdictional practice. I disagree both with this belief and with JUSTICE SCALIA's assessment of the fairness of the transient jurisdiction bargain. / I note, moreover, that the dual conclusions of JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion create a singularly unattractive result. JUSTICE SCALIA suggests that when and if a jurisdictional rule becomes substantively unfair or even ""unconscionable,"" this Court is powerless to alter it. Instead, he is willing to rely on individual States to limit or abandon bases of jurisdiction that have become obsolete. See ante, at 627, and n. 5. This reliance is misplaced, for States have little incentive to limit rules such as transient jurisdiction that make it easier for their own citizens to sue out-of-state defendants. That States are more likely to expand their jurisdiction is illustrated by the adoption by many States of long-arm statutes extending the reach of personal jurisdiction to the limits established by the Federal Constitution. See 2 J. Moore, J. Lucas, H. Fink, & C. Thompson, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 4.41-1[4], p. 4-336 (2d ed. 1989); 4 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1068, pp. 336-339 (1987). Out-of-staters do not vote in state elections or have a voice in state government. We should not assume, therefore, that States will be motivated by ""notions of fairness"" to curb jurisdictional rules like the one at issue here. The reasoning of JUSTICE SCALIA's opinion today is strikingly oblivious to the raison d'etre of various constitutional doctrines designed to protect out-of-staters, such as the Art.

NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”. / CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center. / As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan. / Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music. / Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty). / But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. / She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom. / “It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.” / But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom. / “You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.” / The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.) / Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé. / The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler. / Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier. / Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note. / Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply. / But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance). / She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.” / After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.” / “The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone. / “I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!” / The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule. / Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas. / “I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.” / So she was basically singing into the toilet?“Yep.” / “She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.” / But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way. / When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road: / *When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?* / I don’t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same. / *Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?* / I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat. / *Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?* / No. / *Have you reached out directly?* / I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad. / *When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”* / I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún. / “The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!” / Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend. / Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company. / “My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.” / (Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.) / Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing. / She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went [to clubs], and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ” / After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.” / Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music. / Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr. / She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016. / Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.) / And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story: / “I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.” / A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples. / “I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room. / “It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.” / The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music. / They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.” / “Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.” / Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante. / Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello. / Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop. / “I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.” / In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello. / “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around. / Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her. / “It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ” / She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this. / “I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?” / If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t: / “We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'February 25, 2017', 'Tags': ['Non-Music']}"

He is obviously still half asleep. Martin is in the kitchen and Daphne is busy cleaning the / Dining table. Frasier yawns.) / Daphne: Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. Not a morning person, are we? Well, never you mind. I am. Can't very well be a good health care provider if you're not up with the cock. I've already taken your father for his morning constitutional. Such a remarkable man - thirty years on the police force. I can understand why you'd want him to live here, although not many sons would do that, not without getting paid for it. Anyway / Coffee's made, and I took the liberty of doing a shop. They don't serve much tripe in Seattle, do they? / Frasier: [still groggy] And you are...? / Daphne: Daphne. Daphne Moon. I moved in yesterday. You hired me to take care of your father / Frasier: [realizing] Of course. Forgive me, I'm not quite myself until I've shaved and showered / Daphne: Oh, yes. I completely understand about one's morning ablutions. I, for instance, can't stand myself 'til I floss all that gunk out of my teeth... / Frasier: [interrupting] Miss Moon! For future reference, if you could just keep your ablutions on a need-to-know basis? Thank you. [goes into kitchen] Now, my coffee / Martin: [doing a fry-up] The half 'n half's curdled, and the garbage disposal's jammed / Frasier: [pouring his coffee] Good morning to you too, dad / Martin: Morning was two hours ago. And close that barn door, we got a lady in the house now / Frasier adjusts his robe, then tastes his coffee. He is not amusedFrasier: Hey, this isn't my coffee. Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks? / Martin: That's it. Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it / Frasier: [pouring it down the sink] Didn't that just dress it up? / Martin: I like it. Gives it a zing. Now, come on, sit down. Your breakfast is ready / (He leaves the kitchen with a plate full of fried food.) / Frasier: [following] Oh, no, dad, dad, look, all I ever have is a bran muffin, and a touch of yogurt / Martin: Ah, girlie food. Besides, I already fixed your breakfast. Now, I made you “Eggs in a Nest.” / Frasier: Ah yes, the Crane family specialty. Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in a delightfully hollowed-out piece of white bread. I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak / Martin: You want cheese on that? / Frasier: No. I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain. [to himself] Can't have my coffee, can't have my breakfast, [sees Martin’s chair] Oh god, it wasn't a dream.  / I'll get him for this. [to Eddie] And his little dog, too. /  [opens front door] Where's my paper? Who's stolen my paper? Mrs. Everly, you old bat, I know it's you! / Daphne: Yoo-hoo? It's right here, we brought it in for you / Frasier: [to outside world] Sorry, sorry. [closes door and examines paper] Oh, wait a minute, this... where's the rubber band? This paper has been read / Daphne: Well don't worry, we won't tell you what's in itFrasier: That is not the point. Dad, dad? Come and sit down please, would you? / Daphne: You're going to give a speech, aren't you? / Frasier: Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're psychic / Daphne: Yes, but I think anyone could feel this one coming on / Frasier: Let us get something clear. I am not a morning person. I have to ease into my day slowly. First I have my coffee - sans eggshells or anything else one tends to pick out of the garbage. Then I have a low-fat, high-fiber breakfast. Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper. If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function. My radio show suffers, and like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advise, to help them through their troubled lives. I'm sorry if this may sound priggish, but I have grown comfortable with this part of myself. It is the magic that is me / Martin: [to Daphne, while exiting to the kitchen] Get used to it / Daphne: I know this is a stressful time, and this is new for all of us, but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly. [looks down at Frasier's robe] Ooh, six more weeks of winter, I see / (Frasier closes his robe. He sits at the table and starts reading the paper. Eddie comes over and jumps onto a chair to stare at him.) / Frasier: Down Eddie, down. [Eddie doesn't move] I said down. Good boy Eddie, just get down. Good good, Eddie get down. Eddie, GET DOWN! [Eddie still just sits there, staring at Frasier] Dad, dad, I can't read my paper, Eddie's staring at me / Martin: Why, you do make quite a picture in the morning. Just ignore him / Frasier: I'm trying to / Martin: I was talking to the dog / (Frasier goes back to his paper, holding it up to block Eddie's view. He slowly lifts it far enough to see Eddie still staring at him. He / Gives up and walks towards his private bathroom. Eddie follows.)Frasier: Don't even think about it! [he leaves, Eddie follows] / FADE OUT / -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- / SCENE TWO: KACL / (Frasier is doing his show.) / Frasier: You're listening to Dr. Frasier Crane. Our topic today is... intrusion. Those who encroach on our sense of personal space. The neighbor who plays his stereo too loud. The person who sits next to you in the movie theater when there are fifty other vacant seats. Now let's return to our calls, and let me remind you once more, that our topic today is intrusion, since so many of you seem to be forgetting that / Roz: Dr. Crane, we have Leonard from Everett, on line two / Frasier: Hello Leonard, I'm listening / Leonard: [v.o.] Oh, hi Dr. Crane. Ah, I'm a little nervous, but ah... well, here goes. Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces. Like, if I went to the mall, I'd break out in a cold sweat, I'd get so scared that I'd have to run home / Frasier: Yes Leonard, and your comments on intrusion? / Leonard: Nothing. Just that, now I'm afraid to go outside at all. I haven't seen another person in eight months / Frasier: Well Leonard, it sounds like you may have a very serious condition known as agoraphobia. But you're not alone / Leonard: But I am alone, Dr. Crane / Frasier: Listen Leonard, I'm afraid your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have remaining, so if you stay on the line, someone will give you the name of a qualified therapist. Well, that's all the time we have for today. You've been listening to Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. Stay tuned for the news. Then next up, Bob “Bulldog” Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show. I never miss it. [off air] Yeah, right / Roz: You want your messages? / Frasier: Oh, listen Roz, just hang on to them. I think I'll stay in here for a while. Today more than most, I feel an overwhelming need for solitude. I've got a fascinating book here, a comfortable chair and a soundproof booth. Just as Frasier leans back and opens his book the door opens and Bulldog walks in pushing his props trolley / Bulldog: Hiya, doc. How're they hangin'? / Frasier: Bulldog, what are you doing here? / Bulldog: We lost transmitter link power in Studio C. I gotta do my show from here / (He bangs the gong and blows his whistle, indicating Frasier should leave.) / Bulldog: Hey, where the hell's my Cosell tape? Somebody stole my Cosell tape! THIS STINKS! THIS IS TOTAL B.S.! THIS... oh, here it is / Frasier: [preparing to leave] Let me just get out of your way / Bulldog: Oh, by the way doc, doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasizes about killing his parents? You know what I would have told him? Sports. You go out there, break some heads- [hits himself on the head to illustrate] That'll turn him / Around / Frasier: Yes. If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racquet. [goes into Roz's booth] / Bulldog: Hey, where the hell's my Lasorda tape? THIS IS TOT... ah, got it / (We follow Frasier into Roz's Booth. Roz is on the telephone.) / Roz: [to Frasier, as he starts to exit into the corridor] Hold on a second, I have to ask you something. [into phone] Gary? I broke up with him three weeks ago. The sex was okay, but he was kinda limited. [Frasier moves to leave, Roz stops him] No, no. [into phone] It wasn't that Gary was bad in bed. I mean, he knew where all the parts were. Unfortunately, most of them were his. Yes, totally passionless, it was like he was thinking of someone else. I know I was. Somebody's here, I gotta go. Alright? Talk to you later. Bye, mom. [hangs up] / Frasier: That was your mother? / Roz: Yeah, why? / Frasier: You talk to your mother like that? / Roz: Well, we're both adults. We talk about everything / Frasier: Well, isn't that healthy / Roz: What, you don't talk to your dad like that? / Frasier: Oh, hardly. We hardly speak at all / Roz: Really? / Frasier: Ah yes, well you know, we're just not really similar people. In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother. You know, if it wasn't biologically impossible I'd swear that dad was dropped in a basket on our doorstep / Bulldog: [from other booth] Hey sweetcakes, you seen my engineer? / Roz: I think someone's talking to you, Frasier / Bulldog: Come on, come on, come on! / Roz: [into mike] Yes, he called, he'll be right here. [to Frasier] So do you want to go across the street and have one of those expensive coffee drinks? / Frasier: Maybe some other time. Right now, I'd like to continue my quest for solitude. I'll go somewhere where my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me. I think maybe I'll just go sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park.

Within seconds, the door opens.) / Daphne: [to Martin]...so the elephant says, “He's with me.” [they both laugh] Oh, Dr. Crane, you're home. We just got back from your father's physical therapy / Frasier: Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day. Not that I'm not delighted to see the two of you, it's just that I'm in the middle of a very exciting / Chapter / Daphne: Ooh, I understand. So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you up a nice pot of tea? / Frasier: No, I just poured myself a glass of wine, thank you / Daphne: [pointedly looking at watch] I see. [leaves] / Martin: [sitting in the Chair] Whatcha reading? / Frasier: Oh dad, you wouldn't find it very interesting / Martin: I might. Any good? / Frasier: Well, I haven't formed a opinion yet. Oddly enough, I'm having a little trouble getting into it / Martin: [after a moment's silence, indicates book] Thick / Frasier: Dad will you... Listen, I don't want to offend, but if you wouldn't mind, could you just leave me alone, let me read my / Book? / Martin: No problem / (Martin sits quietly, not looking as Frasier reads. This finally irks Frasier.) / Frasier: What are you doing? / Martin: I'm leaving you alone / Frasier: Well, it's very annoying! / Martin: Ah, what's your problem? You've been sucking a lemon all week / Frasier: All right, all right, I'll tell you what my problem is, I can't get a moment’s peace alone in my own house / Martin: Well, forgive me. When you invited me to move in I didn't realise I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room [starts to leave] / Frasier: [quietly] Perhaps only evenings / Martin: I heard that! / Frasier: Well, of course you heard it, you're never out of earshot! / Martin: Ah, you know, you've always been like this. You were always a fussy little kid, and it's gotten worse ever since. You and your precious morning routine. You gotta have your coffee, you gotta have your quiet, you gotta have this, you gotta have that. Well, aren't you the little hothouse orchid / Frasier: Hey, hey-hey-hey! I don't have to sit here and listen to that! / Martin: Ah, if you want everything so perfect, why don't you go live in a bubble? / Frasier: Oh right, oh well, right now it sounds very inviting! / (He storms out the front door and slams it behind him.) / Martin: [sitting down again] Finally, a little peace and quiet around here / END OF ACT ONE / ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ / ACT TWO / SCENE ONE: CAFE NERVOSA / (Frasier is sitting, reading his book as Niles walks in.) / Niles: Hello there, Frasier / Frasier: Oh, what fresh hell is this? / Niles: That's a nice way to greet your brother. [to waiter] Café latte, per piachere / Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, it's just I've been trying to read this book and it seems no matter where I alight I get interrupted / Niles: Oh, “The Holotropic Mind” by Stanislav Grolf. I love his conclusion that a change in breathing patterns can induce alternate states of consciousness / Frasier: Great. [slams book shut] Now you've ruined the ending! / Niles: I'm sorry, that was inconsiderate. [the waiter brings his coffee] Mille Grazie. [to Frasier] So, how's father? / Frasier: Father? You mean the man who's driving me crazy? The man who makes me dread the sight of my very doorstep? The man who just drove me out of my own home? / Niles: And how's work? / Frasier: Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. Dad and I had another fight. I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof together we'll do irreparable harm to the relationship we have as it is / Niles: Well, what are the alternatives? / Frasier: Well, if I didn't feel so guilty I'd, I'd do what I should have done in the first place: just move dad and Daphne into their own apartment / Niles: Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier. It hasn't been that long, you have to give it a chance. And you might remember why you moved him in in the first place / Frasier: Refresh me / Niles: You wanted to get closer to dad / Frasier: I still do. There isn't anything I'd like more, but he makes it impossible. I can't read my book, I can't have my coffee, I can't have any peace in my own home / Niles: So what you’re saying is, you want to be closer to dad, but you don't actually want him around. Ask yourself Frasier, have you tried to sit down and talk to him - I mean, really talk to him? / Frasier: Well, I... [he thinks about it] Maybe I haven't done my best. I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I? Well ah, thanks for the chat, Niles. You're a good brother, and a credit to the psychiatric profession / Niles: You're a good brother too / (Frasier gets up and leaves.) / ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ / A COUPLE OF WHITE GUYS SITTIN' / 'ROUND TALKIN' / SCENE TWO: FRASIER'S APARTMENT / (Frasier arrives to find some of his furniture piled up beside the door.) / Frasier: Daphne? What are my things doing here? My leather wing chair? My Kusami lamp? / Daphne: [entering from back, carrying a box] We're putting them in the storage room, in the basement. There was no room for them in the study once we got my furniture in. We discussed it last night, remember? / Frasier: Of course, of course / Daphne: I was just on my way to ask that peculiar little man from building services to give me a hand moving them / Frasier: Oh yes, Kyle. Well, give him my regards / Daphne: Remind me again - which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me? / Frasier: The brown one / (Daphne exits via the front door. Martin enters from the bedroom.) / Martin: Daphne left your dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry / Frasier: Well thanks, but I'm not. Ah... Dad, I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier / Martin: Ah, forget about it. I already have / Frasier: You know, I guess there's no secret that there's been a lot of tension between us, and I think maybe one of the reasons is that we never have a chance to sit down and talk. And I... I thought we might have a conversation / Martin: Right now? / Frasier: Yes, I think now would be a good time / Martin: Later would be better / Frasier: It doesn't have to be a long, drawn-out conversation, I'm talking about three minutes of your life / Martin: Well, I hope it is only three minutes, cause my program's coming on / Frasier: Well, alright. If it'll make you any happier I will get the egg-timer and I will set it for three minutes. He does so, and they sit at the table / Martin: So what do you want to talk about? / Frasier: Well, the idea is for us to have a normal, honest conversation like two normal people without getting on each other’s nerves. Ready? [sets timer] Go / Martin: This is stupid / Frasier: [stops timer] One second? That's our personal best? Let us see if we can beat it. [sets timer] Ready? Go / Martin: So how about those Seahawks? / Frasier: [stops timer] No sports / Martin: All right. But no opera / Frasier: Agreed. [sets timer] Ready? Go / Martin: [pause] This is your idea, you say something first / Frasier: Alright, alright. I'll, I'll tell you something about myself that ah, that you don't know. Ah, six months ago, when Lilith and I were really on the rocks,  / ah, there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living. /  I... And then I thought of Frederick / Martin: And you didn't jump, huh? / Frasier: Good, dad / Martin: Wow. I never knew that / Frasier: Well, that's the point of this whole experiment. To tell one another something that we don't know about each other. Something vulnerable. Now it's your turn / Martin: Okay. [thinks] Well, about two months ago, I was in the basement, going through some old pictures of your mother and me... and all of a sudden something flew up in my eye. And, when I was trying to get it out, I realised I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp / Frasier: That's it? You call that vulnerable? / Martin: It hurt / Frasier: Oh well... I'm not talking about that kind of pain, I'm talking about your emotions, your soul. Some sort of painful, gutwrenching experience / Martin: Other than this one? / Frasier: Oh, God! Always the flip answer / Martin: Well, this whole thing's stupid / Frasier: Well, not to me. Oh, how should I expect anything out of you? You are the most cold, intractable, unapproachable, distant, stubborn, cold man I've ever known! / Martin: You said “cold” twice, Mr. Egghead / Frasier: Egghead? Egghead? / Martin: You said “egghead” twice, too / Frasier: Oh, you are so infuriating! / Martin: Well, you're no day at the beach either. You know what you are? [the timer bings] I'll tell you later, it's time for my program. [moves towards Chair] / Frasier: Dad, I don't think you see how serious this is / Martin: Oh, will you give it a rest? / Frasier: We're not getting along, and it's not getting any better. I'm not sure how to say this, but ah... I ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna / Have to... / Martin: I know what you're trying to say. “You want what's best for both of us.” You want to get me out of here, then you can have your own space, and I'll have my own space, and we can put an end to all this bickering / Frasier: Well, yes. I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all / Martin: Except for one thing. I'm not going / Frasier: What? / Martin: Look, you want us to forge some great father-son relationship, to make some connection. Well, that kind of thing takes a couple / Of years, not a couple of days, doesn't it? You're the shrink / Frasier: Couple of years, huh? / Martin: Ah, it'll go by before you know it / Frasier: Either that, or it'll seem like eternity / Martin: I'm willing to give it a shot if you are / Frasier: Okay / Martin: Great. How about you and me having a beer together? / Frasier: Wow. You know, in all these years you've never asked me that. I'd love to have a beer with you, dad / Martin: Well then, you better haul ass, cause the store closes in ten minutes / Frasier: Right.

EXTERIOR  STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL  DAY / The film opens with crowds of girls, shot in a sequence of CLOSE-UPS,  / chasing after GEORGE, JOHN and RINGO. The boys hare off just ahead of them. /  They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them. / 2.	EXT. TERMINAL / They rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates. / 3.	EXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM / We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys. / NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing. / As the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls. / At last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, ""it's not my fault"" and the number proceeds. / SHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them. / As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders. / THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out. / 4.	INTERIOR  RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAINThe boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof. / The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window. / PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again. / The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him. / JOHN / Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man? / PAUL / What little old man? / JOHN / (pointing) / That little old man. / PAUL / Oh, that one.  / That's me Grandfather. / GEORGE / That's not your Grandfather. / PAUL / It is, y'know.GEORGE / But your Grandfather lives in your house.

He now leans forward to him. / JOHN / (in an over-friendly voice) / Hello, Grandfather! / GRANDFATHER / Hello. / JOHN / (delightedly) / He can talk then? / PAUL / (indignantly) / Course he can talk. He's a human being, like.

He's a villain and a right mixer as well. / GEORGE / (disbelieving) / Gerron. / PAUL / No, straight up. / GRANDFATHER / The lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose. / At this moment,  / SHAKE / , a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment. / SHAKE / You got on all right then? / BOYS / Hi, Shake. / SHAKE / We're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets. / He sees GRANDFATHER. / SHAKE / Morning! / (whispers) / Who's that little old man? / GEORGE / It's Paul's grandfather. / SHAKE / Oh aye, but I thought ... / JOHN / (cutting in) / No, that's his other one. / SHAKE / That's all right then. / JOHN / (displaying Grandfather) / Clean though, isn't he? / SHAKE / Oh yes, he's clean all right. / NORM /  the road manager appears behind SHAKE. / NORM / Morning, lads. / BOYS / Morning ... Hi, Norm. / NORM / (checking them quickly) / Well, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ... / He looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails. / NORM / Are you listening to me, Lennon? / JOHN / (off-hand) / You're a swine, isn't he George? / GEORGE / (disinterested) / Yeah ... a swine. / NORM / (just as indifferent) / Thanks... / He sees the GRANDFATHER. / NORM / Eh ... . / BOYS IN CHORUS / ... Who's that little old man? / NORM / Well, who is he? / RINGO / He belongs to Paul. / NORM / (accepting the situation) / Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming? / PAUL / We'll follow you down. / GRANDFATHER rises. / GRANDFATHER / I want me coffee. / NORM / He can come with Shake and me if you like. / PAUL / Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him. / NORM / Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad. / GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM. / NORM / (over Grandfather's head) / He's very clean, isn't he? / SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other. / JOHNSON / Make up your minds, will you! / At last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee. / JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a ""by your leave"" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again. / The boys exchange looks as if to say ... ""Hello, Saucy!!"" / PAUL / (politely) / Do you mind if we have it opened? / JOHNSON / (briefly) / Yes, I do. / JOHN / Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is. / JOHNSON / (rudely) / Well, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights. / RINGO / Aye, well, so have we. / He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word. / RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio.  / A pop number is playing. / JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly. / JOHNSON / And we'll have that thing off as well, thank you. / RINGO / But I ... / JOHNSON leans over and switches it off. / JOHNSON / An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights. / He smiles frostily. / PAUL / Yeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff! / JOHNSON / Then I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong. / JOHN / (leaning forward to him) / Gie's a kiss! / PAUL / Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know. / JOHNSON / I travel on this train regularly, twice a week. / JOHN / Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister? / JOHNSON / And don't you take that tone with me,  / young man / ! / GEORGE / But... / JOHNSON / (accusingly) / I fought the war for your sort. / RINGO / Bet you're sorry you won! / JOHNSON / I'll call the guard! / PAUL / Aye ... but what?

INTERIOR  OF THE CORRIDOR / The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner. / 6.	INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR / From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car. / The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots.

INTERIOR  RESTAURANT CAR / From their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort. / NORM / Yeah, you want to watch it. / SHAKE / (unhappily) / It's not my fault. / NORM / Well, you stick to that story, son. / SHAKE / I can't help it, I'm just taller than you. / GRANDFATHER / (To NORM slyly) / They always say that. / NORM / Yeah, well I got me eye on you. / SHAKE / I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller / than you. / NORM / Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... / (he is about to thump SHAKE.) / JOHN / (enjoying himself) / If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats. / NORM / He started it. / SHAKE / No, I didn't you did ... / GEORGE / Well, what happened? / SHAKE / The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.' / PAUL / And? / NORM / Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me. / PAUL / I knew it, he started it, I should have known. / NORM / Y'what? / PAUL / You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer.  / Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. /  He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it. / The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL. / PAUL / Aye and we'll have to watch it and all. / GEORGE / I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it. / NORM / You're right. Here you are, old devil. / SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL. / GRANDFATHER / Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly? / PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing. / JOHN / Come on let's get this coffee. / GRANDFATHER / Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you! / JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms. / GEORGE / (coyly) / Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!! / JOHN / (invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice) / If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me? / PAUL / (choked) / I'll murder you, Grandfather! / JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down. / GEORGE / Eh, look at that talent. / They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see  / two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN / , having coffee. / JOHN / Give 'em a pull. / PAUL / Shall I? / GEORGE / Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff. / PAUL / Now what's that supposed to mean? / GEORGE / (grinning) / I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it? / JOHN / George Harrison, The  / Scouse /  of Distinction. / We follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head. / PAUL / (in posh accent) / Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy. / The two girls giggle together. / JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides. / GRANDFATHER / (sternly) / I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners. / JEAN / Prisoners!! / GRANDFATHER / Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em. / THE BOYS / Y'what!!! / GRANDFATHER / Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon. / (He points at Ringo) / That little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits. / RINGO / (protesting) / Now look here!! / GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth. / GRANDFATHER / Get out while you can, ladies,  / his time's / coming round for one of his turns. / The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly. / 8.	INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT / SHAKE and NORM are seated.  / SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book. / NORM looks at his watch, slightly worried. / NORM / He's been gone a long time. / SHAKE / (without looking up) / Who? / NORM / Paul's grandfather. / SHAKE / Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go? / NORM / Down the ... er ... / SHAKE / Oh, down the ... er ...? / NORM / Yeah, down the ... er ... / SHAKE / Well, give a couple of minutes ... / He resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying. / 9.	INTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT / Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently. / GRANDFATHER / (proudly) / Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them. / LADY AUDREY / Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney? / GRANDFATHER / Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot. / AUDREY / Of course, John. / GRANDFATHER / Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. ""Mister, can you spare us a copper?"" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner. / AUDREY / The usual ten per cent? / GRANDFATHER / Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them? / AUDREY / (her eyes lighting up) / How fascinating. Do go on ... / (pause) / ... John. / GRANDFATHER / ... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ... / 10.	INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN / NORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee. / NORM / Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather? / JOHN / Of course, he's concealed about me person. / NORM / No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere. / PAUL / (accusingly) / Have you lost him? / NORM / Don't exaggerate. / PAUL / You've lost him. / SHAKE / Put it this way, he's mislaid him. / PAUL / You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you. / SHAKE / He can't be far. / JOHN / I hope he fell off. / PAUL / (mildly) / Don't be callous. / RINGO / He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little. / GEORGE / You've got an inferiority complex, you have. / RINGO / Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor. / JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys. / 11.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR OF TRAIN / PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog. / She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO. / RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her. / He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: ""Who, me?"" / TANIA smiles enthusiastically. / GEORGE has been watching all this. / GEORGE / Are you going in? / RINGO / No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated. / GEORGE / You never know, you might be lucky this time. / RINGO / No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins. / He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on. / 12.	INTERIOR  FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR / PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there. / PAUL / Excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with? / The girls jump up, surprised. / JOHN / We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all! / (he extends his hands as if handcuffed) / Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent. / PAUL / Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss... / He starts to drag JOHN after him. / JOHN / I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back. / JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly. / JOHN / I bet you can guess what I was in for. / He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him. / A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down. / PAUL / How about that one? / He moves towards the compartment. / PAUL / (to Ringo and George) / Did you look in here? / GEORGE / No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something. / PAUL / Well, let's broaden our outlook. / PAUL opens the door of the compartment. / 13.	INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT / From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast. / GRANDFATHER / (looking up) / Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged. / PAUL enters and crosses over to him. / PAUL / Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time  / ... and who's paying for all this? / GRANDFATHER / It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill. / PAUL / Oh, well that's all right. / (realising) / What? / AUDREY / Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance. / PAUL / I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off. / (He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.) / I'll refuse me consent, he's over-age! / AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back. / AUDREY / Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him? / A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY. / PAUL / (pulling) / Him? he's never done anything for anybody in his life. / AUDREY / (pulling) / You dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!! / JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on. / JOHN / Come on, Auntie, you're winning. / GEORGE / Get in there, Paul, she's weakening. / RINGO attempts to interfere. / RINGO / Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ... / AUDREY / Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past. / RINGO / Y'what? / She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him. / RINGO / He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair. / RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag. / A voice shouts off from outside. / VOICE OFF / That's one of them ... stop thief! / 14.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR / From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school. / Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape. / RINGO / (looking down at the handbag in his hand) / Oh Mother!! / 15.	INTERIOR  LUGGAGE VAN / Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing. / In the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene. / GRANDFATHER / (bitterly) / And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars! / PAUL / Don't dramatise. / The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away. / PAUL / Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already. / GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face. / PAUL / Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here. / GRANDFATHER turns away again. / PAUL / All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ... / GRANDFATHER / A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days. / PAUL / Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things? / GRANDFATHER / (cutting in) / You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul? / PAUL / Yeah ... so what? / GRANDFATHER / Why do you always use your left hand? / PAUL / Well, don't be daft, I've got to. / GRANDFATHER / And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to. / PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of / the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box. / PAUL / Shove up! / GRANDFATHER produces a penny. / GRANDFATHER / Odds or evens? / PAUL sighs. / PAUL / Odds. / GRANDFATHER flips the coin. / The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN. / JOHN / (as he sees PAUL behind the bars) / Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy. / PAUL / Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon. / (to Ringo) / Anyroad up ... It's all your fault. / RINGO / Me? Why? / GEORGE / Bag-snatcher. / GRANDFATHER / That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus. / JOHN / (casually) / Every morning. / JOHN has been looking around the guards' van. / JOHN / Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny... / (he pats the dog) / 'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial. / (he shudders) / Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then. / PAUL / Like what? / JOHN / Well, I've got me gob stopper. / (he produces his mouth organ.) / Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham. / And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene. / 16.	EXTERIOR  TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT) / While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London. / 17.	EXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT) / SHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS. / 18.	INTERIOR  GUARDS VAN / By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS. / NORM enters the guards' van. / NORM / Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls. / JOHN / Please, can I have one to surge with? / NORM / No. / JOHN / Ah, go on, you swine. / NORM / No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting. / He points and we see a big car parked across the road. / The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door. / 19.	EXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS / Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them. / NORM / Oh no! / GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed. / GRANDFATHER / All right, lads, follow me. / And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls. / JOHN / Vive l'amour! / NORM drags him away. / 20.	EXTERIOR  RAILWAY STATION / The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car. / The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis  / one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS. / 21.	INTERIOR  BIG CAR / NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back. / NORM / (to the driver) / Go like the clappers, son! / FRANK / (smoothly) / That was my entire intention, sir. / 22.	EXTERIOR  STATION / The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off. / It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins. / 23.	INTERIOR  HOTEL SUITE  NIGHT / There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats. / RINGO / I don't snore. / GEORGE / You do - repeatedly. / RINGO / (to John) / Do I snore? / JOHN / (eating a banana) / You're a window rattler, son. / RINGO / Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul? / PAUL / (stopping playing) / With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't. / GRANDFATHER / Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly. / PAUL / Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke. / GRANDFATHER / Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it. / NORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror. / NORM / Paul, John, George - get at it. / JOHN / Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last. / PAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it. / RINGO / None for me, then? / NORM / Sorry. / John hands RINGO a single envelope. / JOHN / That'll keep you busy. / GRANDFATHER / It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose... / RINGO / You go and pick on your own. / SHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together. / JOHN / Is that yours? / SHAKE / For Ringo. / He dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up. / JOHN / That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo. / GEORGE / He comes from a large family. / RINGO / (dumping the letters) / Well. / RINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card. / RINGO / Eh, what's  / Boyd's Club / ? / The lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads. / PAUL / ""The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of  / Mr Richard Starkey""--that's you-- / ""in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet."" Blimey! / RINGO / (surprised) / And they want me? / JOHN / Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter. / NORM / (snatching the card) / Well you're not going. / RINGO / Ah. / GRANDFATHER / (taking card from Norm) / Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting! / He pockets the card himself. / RINGO / That's mine. / NORM / Have done, and you lot get your pens out. / BOYS / Why? / NORM / It's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot / (he indicates the fan letters) / all answered tonight. / The BOYS all protest. / NORM / I'll brook no denial! / JOHN / It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine. / NORM / Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their / penmanship. / He goes followed by SHAKE. / There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door. / JOHN / While the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for? / With a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door. / GRANDFATHER / What about all these letters? / BOYS / Read 'em! / They disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card. / C.U. GRANDFATHER / GRANDFATHER / And a free champagne buffet. / He grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit. / 24.	INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB  NIGHT / The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement / by all the other customers. During this scene we / CUT AWAY / 25.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB  NIGHT / The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur ""suivez"" and ""banco"" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room. / DEALER / Alors, M'sieur? / GRANDFATHER / (nonchalant) / Souflée. / He turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him. / GRANDFATHER / I bet you're a great swimmer.  / My turn? Bingo! / CROUPIER / Pas ""Bingo,"" M'sieur... Banco. / GRANDFATHER / (taking) / I'll take the little darlings anyway. / He takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered. / GRANDFATHER / Two and one is three, carry one is four. / The buxom BLONDE leans over him. / BLONDE / Lay them down. / GRANDFATHER / (disturbed by his eyeline) / Eh? / BLONDE / Lay them down. / GRANDFATHER / We'd be thrown out. / BLONDE / Your cards... lay them down... face up. / He does so. / CROUPIER / Huit à la pointe... et sept. / (He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.) / BLONDE / You had a lovely little pair, y'see. / GRANDFATHER / I did? / CROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe). / BLONDE / They're yours. / GRANDFATHER / They are? / BLONDE / The cards... you're bank. / 26.	INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB / The BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving. / 27.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB / GRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players. / GRANDFATHER / Bingo! / CROUPIER / (wearily) / M'lord dit ""Bingo."" / WAITER / (to Grandfather) / A little light refreshment. / GRANDFATHER / (lordly) / A glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss. / (He resumes his game.) / Souflée, chop chop. / The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray. / 28.	INTERIOR  DANCING CLUB / The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze. / From their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out. / 29.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S / GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing. / 30.	INTERIOR  HOTEL ROOM / Waiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says ""The manager!"" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying: / NORM / Now get on with it. / JOHN / We were going to do it. / NORM / Aye, well, now! / (He goes through bedroom.) / RINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest. / RINGO / Any of you lot put a man in that cupboard? / ALL / A man? No. / RINGO / Well somebody did. / GEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group. / GEORGE / He's right, y'know. / BOYS / (disinterested) / Ah well, there you go. / SHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out. / SHAKE / Eh, what's all this? / PAUL / Oh, him... He's been lurking. / JOHN / Aye, he looks a right lurker. / SHAKE / (to WAITER) / You're undressed. Where are your clothes? / WAITER / The old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's. / PAUL / No! / RINGO / Oh, he's gone to my club, has he? / PAUL / (turning on Ringo) / Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now. / JOHN / Well, what are we waiting for? / SHAKE / Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours / is worse than any of you lot. / 31.	INTERIOR  BOYD'S / GRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE. / WAITER / Encore de champagne, Monsieur? / GRANDFATHER / Yes, and I'll have some more champagne as well. / He takes another swig of his glass. / MANAGER / (beaming) / Lord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course. / CUSTOMER / Oh I don't know, looks rather clean to me. / The MANAGER comes to grandfather's side. / MANAGER / Play is about to resume, m'lord. / GRANDFATHER / (handing him a chip) / Lead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify. / He takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk. / 32.	INTERIOR  RECEPTION DESK  BOYD'S CLUB / JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance. / ATTENDANT / I'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only. / PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN / I've got to get in. / It's urgent and important. / I've had an invite. / Take me to your leader. / NORM / Shurrup. / The BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. /  He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room. / NORM / All we want to know is have you got a little / old man in there? / MANAGER / (pleasantly) / Do you mean Lord McCartney? / CLOSE-UP PAUL / PAUL / He's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean... / BLONDE / (standing next to Grandfather) / Oh, it must be the dolly floor show. / JOHN / Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him. / GRANDFATHER / Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.) / They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the / entrance desk. They then go to settle up. / MANAGER / (with false charm) / Before you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill. / He snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill. / NORM / (taking it) / I'll settle that. / He glances at it. / NORM / A hundred and eighty pounds! / MANAGER / (icily) / I beg your pardon,  / guineas / . / At that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes. / WAITER / Your winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety / pounds. / The MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money. / GRANDFATHER / How about me change? / MANAGER / Cloak room charge. / He hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh. / RINGO / (brightly) / Ah well, easy come, easy go. / The others glower at him. / RINGO / Well. / 33.	INTERIOR  BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS) / The BOYS have settled down. / JOHN / Should I say it? / GEORGE / Follow your impulse. / RINGO / It'll only get you into trouble. / JOHN / (to RINGO) / Aah, shurrup, misery! / JOHN slouches forward. / JOHN / (urgently) / O.K. Driver, follow that car!! / The driver [Frank] is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform. / FRANK / (indicating the traffic) / Would you like to be a little more precise, sir? / JOHN / Well, that's the wrong line for a start. / FRANK / Sorry? / (meaning: ""I beg your pardon."") / GEORGE / Oh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition. / FRANK / I see. / JOHN / Yeah, you know, ""O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"" / FRANK / Oh, yes, now I'm with you. / [he changes his accent] / But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ... / The car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet. / JOHN / Ever seen one of these before? / FRANK / Ah ... a shamus, eh? / JOHN / I see you go to the night court. / FRANK / I've made the scene. / JOHN / Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out. / GEORGE / I don't think that bit's right. / JOHN / What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler? / 34.	EXTERIOR  STREET / As the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises. / RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. ""Ole"" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which / has just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position. / 35.	INTERIOR  CAR / NORM / Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day. / JOHN / (as Ringo and Paul climb in) / Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal. / FRANK / (to Norm) / We're nearly there, sir. / JOHN / Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is. / CLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM. / NORM / And I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know / why I left. / 36.	EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE / Which has been converted to the T.V. studios. / There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier. / The car approaches. / 37.	INTERIOR OF THE CAR / NORM / Get ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in. / JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment. / At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre. / 38.	INTERIOR  STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE / As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars / and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly. / FIRST P.R.O. MAN / (menacingly) / Press conference, they're waiting for you. / NORM / (jovially) / Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath. / FIRST P.R.O. MAN / (more menacingly) / They're waiting now! / And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle. / PAUL / Eh this lot means it. They're even taking / hostages. / The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs. / 39.	INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM / It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them.. / Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS. / Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place: / SOUND REPORTER / What's your philosophy of life? / JOHN / I'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack. / REPORTER / Has success changed your life? / RINGO / Yes. / REPORTER / Do you like playing the guitar? / GEORGE / Next to kissing girls it's favourites. / PAUL is surrounded by newspapermen. / PAUL / No, actually, we're just good friends. / HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through. / 40.	INTERIOR  THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE / The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches. / PAUL / (ironically) / Anything to spare? / GRANDFATHER / We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your  / John Henry /  on this picture. / GEORGE / Sure. / (He does so). / PAUL / Ah well. Eh, look! / He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well. / PAUL / Let's go and muck in. / JOHN / Aye, before anyone stops us. / They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up. / 41.	INTERIOR  STAGE / Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out: / VOICE / Here, what about these electric guitars? / SHAKE / Where are they? / VOICE / Back here, mate. / SHAKE / (going towards the voice) / I'm coming. / RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man. / RINGO / Leave them drums alone. / FLOOR MANAGER / Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch. / RINGO / If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm / out on strike. / FLOOR MANAGER / Aren't you being rather arbitrary? / RINGO / That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I? / FLOOR MANAGER / Spoil sport! / RINGO / Well! / RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious. / GEORGE / He's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend. / RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over. / PAUL / What's up? / GEORGE / (pointing) / He's sulking again. / JOHN / I'll show him. / He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers. / 42.	INTERIOR  RAMP / As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle. / DIRECTOR / (with over-exaggerated calm) / All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics. / By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride. / JOHN / Aren't you tending to black and white this whole situation? / DIRECTOR / Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting ""a musical arranger"" who would question my ability ... picture-wise. / JOHN / (to the others) / I could listen to him for hours. / PAUL / Heave to, what's all this about a musical arranger? / DIRECTOR / Mr. McCartney Senior! / The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR. / GRANDFATHER / Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test. / DIRECTOR / (bravely) / I'm quite happy to be replaced. / GRANDFATHER / (indicating the director) / He's a typical buck-passer. / DIRECTOR / I won an award. / JOHN / A likely story. / DIRECTOR / It's on the wall in my office. / At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene. / NORM / Hello our lot, everyone happy? / The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently. / NORM / All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do. / DIRECTOR / Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you. / He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him. / DIRECTOR / Give me a bottle of milk and  / a packet of / Oblivion / . Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's / all a plot. / They go left towards the back-stage. / NORM / (producing key) / Now, come on, I've got the key. / He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely. / NORM and the BOYS turn on him. / NORM / Let's have you. / JOHN / Come on speedy! / PAUL / Ringo! / GEORGE / Wake up! / RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading ""Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves."" The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect. / GRANDFATHER / I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act. / He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out ""10"" on his sign, and writes ""9"" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does. / 43.	INTERIOR  THEATRE  BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR / The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor. / JOHN / (to actor) / Gear costume! / ACTOR / (eyeing him) / Swap? / NORM / Right, first floor and no messing about. / NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, ""after you,"" ""No, after you."" NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust. / NORM / Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you. / The BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people. / 44.	INTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR / RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape. / 45.	EXTERIOR  TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE / From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways. / The BOYS scamper down the fire escape. / When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through. / From their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space. / It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day. / They look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow. / The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass. / MAN'S VOICE / (off) / I suppose you know this is private property. / The boys freeze. / From their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by.  / JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man. / JOHN / Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister. / 46.	INTERIOR CORRIDOR  BACK-STAGE / GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm. / 47.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  UNDERNEATH THE STAGE / Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight. / The menacing shadows appear on the stairway. / NORM (voice off) / There's no one here. / SHAKE (voice off) / This is the only way they could have gone. / We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him. / 48.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE / A rehearsal of the toast scene from a  / Strauss Operetta / . The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW. / Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them. / 48A.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM / JOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other. / MILLIE / (as all pass) / Hello. / JOHN / (stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her) / Hello. / MILLIE / Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ... / JOHN / No, not me. / MILLIE / (insistently) / Oh you are, I know you are. / JOHN / No, I'm not. / MILLIE / You are. / JOHN / I'm not, no. / MILLIE / Well, you look like him. / JOHN / Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that. / MILLIE / Oh you do, look. / JOHN looks at himself in the mirror. / JOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully. / JOHN / My eyes are lighter. / MILLIE / (agreeing) / Oh yes. / JOHN / And my nose... / MILLIE / Well, yes your nose is. Very. / JOHN / Is it? / MILLIE / I would have said so. / JOHN / Aye, but you know him well. / MILLIE / (indignantly) / No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance. / JOHN / (knowingly) / That's what you tell me. / MILLIE / (suspiciously) / What have you heard? / JOHN / (blandly) / It's all over the place, everyone knows. / MILLIE / Is it? Is it really? / JOHN / Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it. / MILLIE / I knew I could rely on you. / JOHN / (modestly) / Thanks. / MILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns. / MILLIE / You don't look like him at all. / JOHN winks at her and she winks back. / 49.	INTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM / NORM and SHAKE enter the room.  / The BOYS' TAILOR /  is there waiting for the BOYS. / SHAKE / Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like. / NORM / That's too easy for Lennon. / He crosses to door leading to fire escape. / NORM / (dramatically) / He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me. / SHAKE / You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind. / NORM / Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me. / SHAKE / But John hasn't got any. / NORM / What? / SHAKE / Nerves. / NORM / I know, that's the trouble. / He puffs nervously at his cigarette. / NORM / Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer. / He hears something. / NORM / Get behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide! / The two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM. / JOHN / What are you doing there? / SHAKE / Hiding. / JOHN / I think you're soft or something. / NORM / We weren't hiding. / TAILOR / Now? / NORM / Now. /  We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here? / RINGO / Well ... / NORM / When I tell you to stay put, stay put. / JOHN / (down on his knees) / Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray. / NORM / Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting / for you in the studio. / RINGO / Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work. / NORM / Good lad, Ringo. / PAUL / Oh, listen to teacher's pet. / GEORGE / You crawler. / JOHN / He's betrayed the class. / RINGO / Oh, leave off!!! / JOHN / Temper! Temper! / RINGO / Well ... / CLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face. / NORM / Will you all get a move on! They're waiting for / you! / By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape. / JOHN / I now declare this bridge open. / The BOYS run out the door. / 50.	INTERIOR  BACKSTAGE AREA / Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates. / From the door off stage, above which is a sign ""To Canteen and Production Offices"", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and / three. He goes to be measured with the sweater. / From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate. / We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly. / We hear the DIRECTOR's voice. / DIRECTOR (V.O.) / All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act. / We / CUT TO / centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate. / The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help. / We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE. / 51.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR / CLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR. / DIRECTOR / Where are they? I said, where are they? Where are they? / FLOOR MANAGER / (placating) / They're coming, I promise you. / DIRECTOR / (fiercely) / Now look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!! / Two STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR. / 1st STAGE HAND / What's he on about, Taff? / WELSH STAGE HAND / Well ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind. / At this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play. / JOHN / (to the director) / Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they? / The director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens. / DIRECTOR / (to himself) / Of course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace. / RINGO / Are you as young as that, then? / BOYS / Shurrup! / GRANDFATHER / Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas. / PAUL / (to Shake) / Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you? / SHAKE / I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know. / PAUL / (threateningly) / I'll set John on you! / SHAKE / (hastily) / Oh, anything you say, Paul. / He leads GRANDFATHER away. / The BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them.  / There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it. / DIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy) / Run through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions. / The BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. /  When they've finished, they stand about spare. / 52.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM / The room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress. / DIRECTOR / That was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ... / (to make-up woman) / Oh how about make-up? / MAKE-UP WOMAN / Not really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine. / DIRECTOR / Good. Norm, get them along to make-up will you? / NORM / (rising) / Sure. / DIRECTOR / (looking into the monitor) / And hurry, they're not looking too happy. / From the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio. / 53.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR / PAUL / (to Ringo) / What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman. / RINGO / (briefly) / You were twanging too loud. / JOHN / How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo? / GEORGE / You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today. / RINGO / That's right. It's always me, isn't it? / JOHN / Since you ask, yes. / (he laughs) / Aah, come on, Ring, we love you. / He puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder. / RINGO / Well! / JOHN / He'll get over it. / NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches. / NORM / All right, our lot, make-up. / 54.	INTERIOR  MAKE UP ROOM / A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny. / SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out. / SHAKE / You blinked! / GRANDFATHER / I never did, you did. / The BOYS enter. / SHAKE / Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk. / GEORGE / Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the / champ here. / He indicates RINGO who ignores him. / NORM / Stop picking on him. / RINGO / I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm. / JOHN / Leave him alone, he's got swine fever. / NORM / Sit down, the lot of you. / At this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up. / Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of ""aye aye's"" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things. / HEAD MAKE UP GIRL / Oh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time. / ACTOR / Well, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not. / (sees John with beard) / And who's me, then? / JOHN / (charmingly) / My name's Betty... / (pointing to the name on the mirror) / Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic? / NORM fights his way to JOHN. / NORM / Now listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you. / SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of ""Queen"" Magazine. / NORM / (to Ringo) / What do you think are you're up to? / RINGO / Someone put it on me. / JOHN / Excuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams. / The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off. / JOHN / You won't interfere with the basic rugged / concept of my personality, will you, girl? / PAUL / Eh, don't take out me lines. / GEORGE / Yeah, they give him that ""Je ne sais quoi"" / rakish air. / The lads laugh with pleasure. / RINGO decides to try a little joke. / RINGO / (indicating the busby he is still / wearing) / Short back and sides, please. / The other look at him with mock disgust. / PAUL / Behave... / JOHN / Foreign devil ... / GEORGE / Control yourself... / GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process. / GRANDFATHER / In my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies. / JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl. / JOHN / You know you're only jealous! / And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance. / NORM / Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you. / JOHN / You wouldn't! / NORM / I would though. / NORM goes out. / PAUL / What's he know? / JOHN / Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind. / GRANDFATHER / (impatiently) / Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed.  / This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney. / GIRL / (admiringly) / What a clean old man. / GRANDFATHER / (touchingly) / You're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so /  don't press your luck. / JOHN / He's sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin. / NORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio. / NORM / They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call. / JOHN / (jumping from his seat) / Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance. / JOHN'S GIRL / I don't think its allowed. / JOHN / Well ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was! / The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio. / The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up. / As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the ""Strauss"" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut. / JOHN / (passing him) / Never. / During dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath. / 55.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR / The work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. /  LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage  / ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA. / 56.	INTERIOR  CONTROL ROOM / The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on. / We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor.  / When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number. / So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four. / When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor. / 57.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR / DIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY / Thank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show. / The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll. / NORM is on them at once. / NORM / That was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre. / JOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer. / JOHN / She's going to show me her stamp collection. / PAUL / (grabs a showgirl) / So's mine. / NORM / John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important. / JOHN / (like a pig) / Oink! Oink! / They dash off with the two beauties. / GRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE. / GRANDFATHER / I want me cup of tea. / NORM / Shake. / SHAKE / I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance. / NORM / Clever. / (he turns) / George. / But GEORGE is disappearing out of the door. / NORM turns to RINGO. / NORM / Look after him. / RINGO / But... / NORM / Do I have to raise me voice? / RINGO / (choked) / Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad. / And the two of them walk off, Ringo leading. / 57A.	INTERIOR  BACKSTAGE / A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls. / GRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off. / We / CUT TO / THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor. / 58.	INTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN / The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book. / GRANDFATHER / (disgustedly to no one in particular) / Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book! / RINGO / Well ... what's the matter with that? / GRANDFATHER / (taking the book from him) / Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that? / RINGO / (snatching back his book) / You can learn from books. / GRANDFATHER / Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living. / RINGO / Out where? / GRANDFATHER / Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish! / RINGO / (defiantly) / Books are good! / GRANDFATHER / (countering) / Parading's better! / RINGO / Parading? / GRANDFATHER / (marching up and down the canteen) / That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living! / RINGO / Well, I am living, aren't I? / GRANDFATHER / You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare? / RINGO / Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you? / GRANDFATHER / At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book! / RINGO / Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them. / GRANDFATHER / So you are a man after all. / RINGO / What's that mean? / GRANDFATHER / Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature. / RINGO / (not too sure) / Oh ... I dunno. / GRANDFATHER / (confidingly) / And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know. / RINGO / Yeah ... that's right. / GRANDFATHER / And what's it all come to in the end? / RINGO / (defensively) / Yeah ... what's in it for me? / GRANDFATHER / A book! / RINGO / Yeah ... a bloomin' book! / He throws the book down. / GRANDFATHER / When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me.  / A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office. / RINGO / Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it? / GRANDFATHER / (nodding) / You're only right. / RINGO / (nodding back) / I'm not wrong. / There is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door. / GRANDFATHER / Where are you off to? / RINGO / I'm going parading before it's too late! / RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried. / 59.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY / RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs. / GEORGE / Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me? / RINGO / (passing him) / No. I don't. / As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE. / RINGO / You want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face. / 60.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE / JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation. / JOHN / Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder. / RINGO looks at JOHN hard. / PAUL / Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man. / RINGO / (with simple dignity) / Get knotted! / PAUL and JOHN gape at him. /  For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street. / PAUL / We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us. / JOHN / Can't he? He's done it, son! / GEORGE runs towards them. / GEORGE / Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ... / PAUL / We do. / GEORGE / Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up. / PAUL / He hasn't. / GEORGE / Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly. / PAUL / The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right. / The three of them go into the street. / 61.	EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE / The boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared. / PAUL / We'll split up and search for him, he can't be far. / They now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way. / JOHN / It's happened at last, we've become a limited company. / GEORGE / I'll look in here again. / PAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways. / 62.	EXTERIOR  STREET / RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying ""We Buy Anything"" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him. / RINGO / Hello. / GIRL / Get out of it, short house! / CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road. / 63.	EXTERIOR  TOW PATH  CANAL / RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle. / POLICEMAN / Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about. / Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared. / RINGO / (shouting after him) / Southerner! / He looks at the canal water moodily;  / at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. /  A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO. / BOY / Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it. / RINGO / Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it? / BOY / Oh don't be so stroppy! / RINGO / (getting up) / Well! A boy of your age bowling ""hoop"" at people. How old are you anyway? / BOY / (aggressively) / Nine. / RINGO / Bet you're only eight and a half. / BOY / (countering swiftly) / Eight and two thirds. / RINGO / Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop. / BOY / Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old. / RINGO / Shurrup! / BOY / I bet you're / (searching for an age) / -- sixteen! / RINGO / Fifteen and two thirds, actually. / BOY / Well -- / RINGO / All right, take your hoop and bowl. / He moves off and the BOY follows. / BOY / Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me. / RINGO / Y'what? / BOY / You heard, it gets on my wick. / RINGO / Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school? / BOY / I'm a deserter. / RINGO / (smiling in spite of himself) / Are you now? / BOY / Yeah, I've blown school out. / RINGO / Just you? / BOY / No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong. / RINGO / Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh? / BOY / Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come / with us but they chickened. / RINGO / Yeah? And they're your mates are they? / BOY / (sighing) / Yeah. / RINGO / Not much cop without 'em, is it? / BOY / (defensively) / Oh, it's all right. / RINGO / (disbelievingly) / Yeah? / BOY / Yeah. / RINGO / What they like? / BOY is glad to have something to talk about. / BOY / (enthusiastically) / Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting. / RINGO / How about Ding Dong? / BOY / He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang. / RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together. / BOY / Why aren't you at work? / RINGO / I'm a deserter, too. / BOY / Oh. / At this moment a child's voice shouts out ""Charley"" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly. / BOY / (to Ringo) / See you. / The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone. / 64.	INTERIOR  CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE / GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying ""Canteen and Production Office Opposite."" He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters [the] building. / 65.	INTERIOR  OFFICE / It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once. / SECRETARY / Oh, there you are! / GEORGE / Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake. / SECRETARY / (tartly) / You haven't, you're just late. / (She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.) / Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you. / GEORGE / Is he? / SECRETARY / Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap. / (She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.) / Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him. / (she smiles) / Of course, right away. / She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it. / SECRETARY / Well ... come on. / GEORGE / Sorry. / He follows her quickly in. / 66.	INTERIOR  THE INNER OFFICE / A large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor. / Behind a large desk sits  / SIMON MARSHAL / , a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, ""Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."" / SECRETARY / (proudly) / Will this do, Simon? / SIMON / (looking at George) / Not bad, dolly, not really bad. / (he motions to George) / Turn around, chicky baby. / GEORGE does so. / SIMON / Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan. / (he indicates the girl on the poster) / All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian. / ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON. / GEORGE / Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding. / SIMON / (sharply) / Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit. / GEORGE / I'm afraid I don't understand. / SIMON / Oh, my God, he's a natural. / SECRETARY (anxiously) / Well, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones. / SIMON / They ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type. / He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots. / SIMON / We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers. / GEORGE / Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality. / SIMON / Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it. / (to secretary) / Can he read? / GEORGE / Of course I can. / SIMON / I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines? / GEORGE / I'll have a bash. / SIMON / Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama? / GEORGE / Ta. / SIMON / Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian. / A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him. / SIMON / Now, you'll like these. You really ""dig"" them. They're ""fab"" and all the other pimply hyperboles. / GEORGE / I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead  / grotty / . / SIMON / Grotty? / GEORGE / Yeah, grotesque. / SIMON / (to secretary) / Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're  / grotty / , you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want. / GEORGE / But I won't. / SIMON / You can be replaced you know, chicky baby. / GEORGE / I don't care. / SIMON / And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate. / GEORGE / And who's this Susan when she's at home? / SIMON / (playing his ace) / Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol. / GEORGE / Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong? / SIMON / I beg your pardon? / GEORGE / Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish. / SIMON / She's a trend setter. It's her profession! / GEORGE / She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things. / SIMON / Get him out of here!! / GEORGE / (genuinely surprised) / Have I said something amiss? / SIMON / Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!! / The underlings hustle GEORGE to the door. / GEORGE / (smiling) / Sorry about the shirts. / He is ejected through the door. / SIMON / Get him out. / (he stops in mid-shout) / You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you? / SECRETARY / You mean an early clue to the new direction? / SIMON / (rummaging in his desk) / Where's the calendar? / (he finds it) / No, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances! / 67.	EXTERIOR  STREET  PUB ON THE CORNER / The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so. / 68.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM / The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly. / GRANDFATHER / I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest. / DIRECTOR / If he says that again, I'll strike him. / SHAKE / (unconvincingly) / They'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back. / DIRECTOR / (disgusted) / Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through. / GRANDFATHER / I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself. / NORM / (grimly, C.U.) / God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it. / 69.	INT. PUB  PUBLIC BAR / CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand. / BARMAID / (accusingly) / That was fresh this morning. / We now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table. / Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby. / BARMAID / (to Ringo) / That'll be two and nine... / RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs / away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough. / BARMAID / Right ... On your way! / RINGO / Y'what? / BARMAID / You heard, on your way, troublemaker! / Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ... / 70.	EXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE PUB / RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious. / 71.	EXTERIOR  STREET / PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, ""TV Rehearsal Room."" As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside. / 72.	INTERIOR  HALL / PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in. / 73.	INTERIOR  REHEARSAL ROOM / PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming. / GIRL / If I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me. / She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was. / GIRL / (surprised) / Oh! / PAUL / (enthusiastically) / Well ... go 'head, do the next bit. / GIRL / Go away! You've spoilt it. / PAUL / Oh, sorry I spoke. / He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next. / GIRL / Are you supposed to be here? / PAUL / I've got you worried, haven't I? / GIRL / I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute. / PAUL / D'you know something, ""They"" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ... / GIRL / You're from Liverpool, aren't you? / PAUL / (ironically) / How'd you guess? / GIRL / (seriously) / Oh, it's the way you talk. / PAUL / (innocently) / Is it ... is it, really? / GIRL / (suspiciously) / Are you pulling my leg? / PAUL / (looking her straight in the eye) / Something like that. / GIRL / (unsure) / I see. / (airily) / Do you like the play? / PAUL / Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl. / (smiles to himself) / Yeah, it's gear on a girl. / GIRL / Gear? / PAUL / Aye, the big hammer, smashing! / GIRL / Thank you. / PAUL / Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like? / GIRL pouts. / PAUL / You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ... / GIRL / (cutting in) / I'm not ... / PAUL / Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing? / GIRL / No. / (aggressively) / I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines. / PAUL / Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you? / GIRL / Yes. / PAUL / Aye, I knew you were. / GIRL / What's that mean? / PAUL / Well, the way you were spouting, like .... / (he imitates her) / ""I don't believe you, sir..."" and all that. Yeah, it was gear. / GIRL / (dryly) / The big hammer? / PAUL / (smiling) / Oh aye, a sledge. / GIRL / But the way you did it then sounded so phony. / PAUL / No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know. / He moves and stands about like an actress. / GIRL / But that's not like a real person at all. / PAUL / Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they? / GIRL / They ought to be. / PAUL / Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they? / GIRL / (teasingly) / What are you? / PAUL / I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing. / GIRL / I bet you don't sound like real people. / PAUL / We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab. / GIRL / Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself? / PAUL / What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing. / He laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio / PAUL / ... all this and a jam butty too!! / GIRL / I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in. / PAUL / Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish? / GIRL / Why selfish? / PAUL / Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee. / She looks at him in surprise. / PAUL / No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, ""Go and give some to the other kids."" So, I said I would but I thought to meself, ""She must think I'm soft."" Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me? / GIRL / Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine? / PAUL / Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she? / GIRL / Is she? / PAUL / Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ... / (Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg) / Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!! / GIRL / (shattered) / And you honestly think that's what she meant? / PAUL / Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh. / He laughs. / GIRL / Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever. / PAUL / (grinning) / And cunning. / GIRL / And what do you do about it? / PAUL / Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time. / GIRL / Pity. / PAUL / (not noticing the invitation) / Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back. / GIRL / Yes. / PAUL / (going) / See you. / GIRL / Of course. / PAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out. / 74.	EXTERIOR  STREET / In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN. / [Scenes 75 and 76 deleted in revision.] / 77.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  NEAR STAGE DOOR / The DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push. / NORM / Worry, will you! / SHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression. / DIRECTOR / (bitterly) / Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it... / NORM / I'll murder that Lennon. / DIRECTOR / But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long... / SHAKE / ... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like. / NORM / Shurrup, cheerful. / The horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR. / DIRECTOR / You don't think... / NORM / (reassuring him) / They'll be here. / DIRECTOR / Oh now, they can't do that to me. / (turning on Norm) / It's all your fault. / (overriding Norm) / Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the... / SHAKE / (helping out) / ... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I. / He steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR. / NORM / Traitor! / SHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character. / SHAKE / Of course. / At this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM. / JOHN / (as he passes by) / Hi Norm! / NORM / (preoccupied) / Hi, our lot! / The BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to. / NORM / Our lot! / GEORGE / (mildly) / Did you want something. / NORM / (beaming with delight) / I could eat the lot of you. / JOHN / You'd look gear with an apple in your gob. / DIRECTOR / (accusingly) / Do you realise you could have missed the final run-through? / GEORGE / Sorry. / SHAKE / Eh, there's only three of them. / PAUL / Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back. / DIRECTOR / Do you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short. / JOHN / Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere. / NORM / Aye, let's try the dressing room. / Everyone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last. / PAUL / Eh, where's my grandfather? / NORM / Don't worry about him. He can look after himself. / PAUL / Aye, I suppose so. / They run after the others. / 78.	EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CLOSE-UP / GRANDFATHER / Here they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters! / The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: ""Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs."" On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off. / 79.	INTERIOR  POLICE STATION / It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before. / RINGO / Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo... / POLICEMAN / Sure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge. / SERGEANT / What is he? / POLICEMAN / (reeling off the list) / I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it. / SERGEANT / Oh, a little savage, is he? / POLICEMAN / A proper Aborigine. / RINGO / (on his dignity) / I demand to see me solicitor. / SERGEANT / What's his name? / RINGO / Oh, well if you're going to get technical -- / At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood. / SERGEANT / Hello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it? / (to policeman) / Sit Charley Peace down over there. / The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them. / GRANDFATHER / Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me. / (kicks the nearest policeman) / Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still. / SERGEANT / Is there a fire, then? / GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT. / GRANDFATHER / You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser. / SERGEANT / Eh? / GRANDFATHER / I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap. / SERGEANT / What's he on about? / GRANDFATHER / (squaring up) / I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again. / SERGEANT / (to policemen) / Get  / Lloyd George /  over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out. / The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth. / GRANDFATHER / Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they? / RINGO / Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient. / GRANDFATHER / Shush! Have they roughed you up yet? / RINGO / What? / GRANDFATHER / (whispering) / Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. /  Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you. / RINGO / (disturbed) / Have they? / GRANDFATHER / That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. /  One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you. / RINGO / (horrified) / Me! / GRANDFATHER / And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket. / RINGO / (hopefully) / Oh, they seem all right to me. / GRANDFATHER / That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains. / SERGEANT / (calling) / Would you two like a cup of tea? / GRANDFATHER / You see, sly villains. / RINGO / (miserable) / No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir. / We now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk. / SERGEANT / So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good. / POLICEMAN / Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station. / SERGEANT / Well, he can't stop here. / Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does. / RINGO / What are you doing? / GRANDFATHER / Lip reading. / RINGO / What are they saying? / GRANDFATHER / Nothing good. / The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO. / GRANDFATHER / Well son, it's now or never. / He jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door. / GRANDFATHER / All right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny. / He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos. / SERGEANT / Now, what's he up to? / RINGO / He's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies. / The POLICEMAN with the photos returns. / POLICEMAN / (Irish accent) / Your man disappeared like a leveret over a hill. / RINGO / Turncoat! / The POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him. / CLOSE-UP  RINGO / RINGO / Mother! / 80.	EXTERIOR  STREET / GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes. / CLOSE-UP  GRANDFATHER's horrified face. / GRANDFATHER / Be God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out! / He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force. / They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER. / 81.	INTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CONTROL ROOM / DIRECTOR / (watching the clock) / Only half an hour and you're on! / GEORGE / Can I say something? / The director clutches at any straw. / DIRECTOR / (hopefully) / Yes, anything. / GEORGE / (earnestly) / It's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc.... / But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR. / 82.	EXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  STAGE DOOR / The four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the / security guard. / GUARD / (going back into theatre) / I'll have the hides off of you lot. / The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard. / GUARD / You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home! / GRANDFATHER / I must see Pauly. / GUARD / Go home then and see him on the telly. / The GUARD re-enters the stage door. / GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer. / GRANDFATHER / Can you fix him for me? / BOYS / Yeah. / GRANDFATHER / Sixpence. / BOY / Each? / GRANDFATHER is about to argue. / GRANDFATHER / Oh, all right. / BOY / And in advance. / GRANDFATHER / (disgusted) / Mercenary! / But he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door. / 83.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM  ON STAGE / GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay. / 84.	INTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM / The DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage. / DIRECTOR / (shouting) / It's all right, leave him alone. / PAUL / Grandad, where's Ringo? / GRANDFATHER / The police have the poor unfortunate lad in  / the Bridewell / . / BOYS / The police station. / GRANDFATHER / He'll be pulp by now. / JOHN / What are we waiting for? / GEORGE / Come here. / PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off. / CLOSE-UP DIRECTOR / DIRECTOR / We've only got twenty minutes. / 85.	EXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION / PAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees  high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside. / 86.	INTERIOR  POLICE STATION / The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath. / SERGEANT / What is all this? / JOHN / (heaving and panting) / Hold on until we get our breath. / The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered. / SERGEANT / All right now? / JOHN / Sure. / (to boys) / Ready? / The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street. / 87.	EXTERIOR  STREET / THE CHASE CARRIES ON. / Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them.  / The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it. / JOHN / Ah well, it was worth a try. / INSPECTOR / (calling to Sergeant) / What do you think you're up to? / SERGEANT / Arrest those boys, sir. / INSPECTOR / That's all we need to start a real riot! / (to Boys) / Come on lads, they're waiting for you. / ###	INTERIOR  THEATRE BACKSTAGE / The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on. / DIRECTOR / Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life. / NORM / Aren't you supposed to be in that box? / The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off. / PAUL / And another thing, where's that old mixer? / GRANDFATHER / Here, Pauly. / And sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER. / PAUL / Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney. / JOHN / Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old. / PAUL / (hotly) / What's old got to do with it? / JOHN / You needn't bother. / PAUL / Y'what? / JOHN / Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already. / PAUL / Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker! / JOHN / That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you? / From JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man. / JOHN / You see. / (to Grandad) / You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool. / GRANDFATHER / (fighting back) / But I'm clean. / The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back. / 88.	INTERIOR  TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM / We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself.  / The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, /  i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again.  / As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as /  they finish their act and take their final bows. / 89.	INTERIOR  STUDIO CORRIDOR / NORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem. / NORM / I've got the stuff. Come here. / PAUL / Aren't we ... / NORM / No, we're not! / He hurries them along. / NORM / The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton. / JOHN / Tonight? We can't make it ... / NORM / You've got a midnight matinee. / JOHN / Now, look here, Norm ... / NORM / No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you. / JOHN / What? / NORM / You're a swine.  / So hurry up ... we're travelling! / NORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter. / 90.	EXTERIOR  STAGE DOOR  T.V. THEATRE / The BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter. / PAUL / (looking behind him) / Where's my grandfather? / NORM / (arriving at helicopter door) / Don't start. Look. / The boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos. / GRANDFATHER / (beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos) / Come on, you're hanging up the parade. / The boys shout ""Get rid of those things, etc."" / 91.	EXTERIOR  FIELD / The final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window. / We cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'July 6, 1964', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Screen']}"

Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.  / The /  man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.  / Nine /  twelve bloodflows  / chiding her childless. / And whiles they spake /  the  / door /  of the castle was opened and there nighed them a  / mickle /  noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young  / learningknight yclept Dixon / .  / And /  the traveller Leopold was  / couth /  to him  / sithen /  it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and  / chrism /  as much as he might suffice.  / And /  he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.  / And /  the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of  / cautels /  and a  / subtile / . Also the lady was of his  / avis /  and repreved the learningknight though she  / trowed /  well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her  / mandement /   / ne have him in aught contrarious to his list /  and he said how it was a marvellous castle.  / And /  the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and  / sometime venery / . / And /  in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by  / swinking /  demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.  / And /  there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.  / And /  full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no  / wight /  could devise a fuller ne richer.  / And /  there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it  / natheless /  they are so. And these  / fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal /  land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.  / And /  also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund  / wheatkidneys /  out of  / Chaldee /  that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.  / And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. / And /  the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.  / And /  childe Leopold did  / up his beaver /  for to pleasure him and took  / apertly /  somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.  / And /  he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.  / Thanked be Almighty God. / This meanwhile this good sister /   / stood /  by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our  / alther liege Lord /  to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.  / Sir /  Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and  / he wondered /  what cry that it was whether of child or woman and  / I marvel, said he / , that it be not come or now.  / Meseems /  it dureth overlong.  / And /  he was ware and saw a  / franklin that hight Lenehan /  on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.  / But / , said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.  / And /  the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.  / Also /  he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.  / And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest /   / that /  ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.  / Woman's /  woe with wonder pondering. / Now /  let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.  / There /  was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the  / franklin that hight Lenehan /  and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( / and /  of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.  / But /  on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.  / And /  sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.  / Ruth /   / red /  him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave. / For /  they were right witty scholars.  / And /  he heard their  / aresouns /  each  / gen /  other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all  / leeches /  and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).  / And /  they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the  / woman should bring forth in pain /  and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.  / And /  not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.  / A /  redress God grant.  / This /  was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.  / In /  colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.  / Then /  young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by  / rede /  of palmer and  / bedesman /  and for a vow he had made to  / Saint Ultan of Arbraccan /  her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.  / To /  whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.  / Both /  babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in  / limbo /  gloom, the other in purgefire.  / But / ,  / gramercy / ,  / what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise / , which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?  / For / , sirs, he said, our lust is brief.  / We /  are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.  / Then /  said Dixon junior to Punch Costello  / wist /  he what ends.  / But /  he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or  / leman /  if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.  / Whereat /  Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast  / the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn / , the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.  / Thereat /  laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not  / bewray /  and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.  / Then /  spake young Stephen  / orgulous /  of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of  / Lilith, patron of abortions / , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as  / Virgilius /  saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _ / effectu secuto / _, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and  / Moses Maimonides / .  / He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused /  and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's greater glory whereas  / that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon /  for so saith he that holdeth the  / fisherman's seal / , even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.  / All /  they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.  / A /  wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his  / won't /  was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good  / for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence /  and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.  / That /  is truth,  / pardy / , said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.  / Which /  hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he  / averred /  that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared  / eftsoons / . / But /  sir Leopold was passing grave  / maugre /  his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.  / And /  she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie  / akeled /  (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those  / wastrels /  and murdered his goods with whores. / About that present time /   / young /  Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the  / vicar of Christ /  which also as he said is  / vicar of Bray / .  / Now /  drink we, quod he, of this  / mazer /  and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul's bodiment.  / Leave /  ye fraction of bread to them that  / live by bread alone / .  / Be /  not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.  / See /  ye here.  / And /  he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.  / They /  all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth:  / Know /  all men, he said,  / time's ruins build eternity's mansions / .  / What /  means this?  / Desire's wind blasts the thorntree /  but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.  / Mark me now / .  / In /  woman's womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the postcreation. _ / Omnis caro ad te venie / t_.  / No /  question but  / her /  name is  / puissant /   / who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd / , our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _ / omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem / _, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive  / anastomosis /  of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny  / pippin / . But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature,  / _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_ / , or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with  / Peter Piscator /  who lives in the  / house that Jack built /  and with  / Joseph the joiner /  patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _ / parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'était le sacre pigeon, ventre de Dieu! /   / Entweder_ transubstantiality ODER consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality / . And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we withstand, withsay. / Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was  / put in pod /  of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no  / gasteful /  turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her  / megrims /  and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of  / blandishments /  others whiles they all chode with him, a  / murrain /  seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou  / got in peasestraw / , thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou  / dykedropt / , thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his  / cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle / , advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne's house  / rest should reign. / To be short /  this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take  / friar's vows /  and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of  / nard /  and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _ / Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium / _ till she was there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen  / minim /  by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their  / _Maid's Tragedy_ /  t / hat was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ /  was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.  / An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion. /  Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named  / Beau Mount and Lecher /  for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.  / Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. /  Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect,  / saith Zarathustra / , sometime regius professor of  / French letters /  to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed.  / _Orate, fratres, pro memetipso_ / . And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and  / kick like Jeshurum / . Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.  / Return, return, Clan Milly / : forget me not, O  / Milesian / . Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a  / merchant of jalaps /  and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from  / Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah /  and from the  / Horns of Hatten /  unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth. This  / tenebrosity /  of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the  / wit of the septuagint /  nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell's gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.  / Assuefaction /  minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and  / Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion / . The  / adiaphane /  in the noon of life is an Egypt's plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper _ / ubi_ and _quomodo / _. And  / as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. /  The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of  / fasciated /   / wattles / : at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the  / conclamation /  of the hillcat and the  / ossifrage / . And as no man knows the ubicity of his  / tumulus /  nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to  / Tophet or to Edenville /  in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the  / whatness /  of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness. / Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _ / Etienne chanson / _ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the  / crystal palace /  of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea. / _ / Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac. / _A black crack of noise in the street here / , alack, bawled back. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm that  / hist /  his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so  / doughty /  waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the  / braggart boaster /  cried that an old  / Nobodaddy /  was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne's hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart's side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the  / order of a natural phenomenon. / But was young Boasthard's fear /  vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.  / Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth /  or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which  / Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. /  Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her  / grot /  which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence. / This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a  / stout shield of oxengut /  and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to  / bring brenningly biddeth. / So Thursday sixteenth June /  Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with  / kirtles /  catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or  / fiacre /  seen about but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore's the writer's ( / that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite / ) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a month yet  / till Saint Swithin /  and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and  / beef to the heel / , and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne's. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy's, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better,  / be /  having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king's bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their  / queerities no telling how. / With this came up Lenehan /  to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a  / merryandrew /  or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers,  / ladies of the bagnio /  and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable  / catchpole /  or a  / tipstaff /  often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his  / sackpossets /  much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.  / _Mort aux vaches_ / , says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a  / sutler /  or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the  / romany folk / , kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen,  / and he sent the ale purling about, /  an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.  / It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose / . True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could  / doss /  and dung to his heart's content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our  / cozening /  dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in  / Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo /  that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas  / all the old Nicks in the world /  and an old whoremaster that kept seven  / trulls /  in his house and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards,  / sprang their luff / , heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: / _-- / Pope Peter's but a pissabed / . A man's a man for a' that._ / Our worthy acquaintance /  Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their  / apologue /  accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a  / cornetcy in the fencibles /  and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator.  / Lambay Island / _. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling  / Popinjay /  and sir Milksop  / Quidnunc /  in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes,  / who hide their flambeau under a bushel /  in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _ / Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt /  and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and  / coneys /  there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to  / carry coals to Newcastle / . Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention:  / _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_ / , while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck. / Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those  / loaves and fishes /  and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient  / ventripotence / , upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr  / Austin Meldon / , to a wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though  / 'tis pity she's a trollop / ): There's a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some  / larum in the antechamber. / Here the listener /  who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as  / tow / , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.  / _Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_ / . That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _ / marchand de capotes / _, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle  / AVEC LUI /  in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ / ventre biche / _, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _ / sans blague / _, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a  / sou / . One  / umbrella / , were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _ / il y a deux choses / _ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her  / tilbury / , to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our  / store of knowledge. / Amid the general vacant /  hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she ain't in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was  / enceinte /  which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back  / on with a loving heart. / To revert to Mr Bloom /  who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects  / resiled /  from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.  / But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. /  It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the  / bounty of the Supreme Being. / Accordingly he broke his mind /  to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another  / Ephesian matron / . I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with  / dundrearies / , preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. 'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a  / linkboy /  (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the  / puerperal /  dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the  / seminaries of such frivolity / , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together. / But with what fitness, /  let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his  / granados /  did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very  / pelican in his piety / , who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with  / Hagar, the Egyptian! /  In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,  / acid and inoperative.The news was imparted /  with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the  / Sublime Porte /  by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of  / abigail /  and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the  / acardiac /  _ / foetus in foetu / _ and  / aprosopia /  due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of  / defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line /  so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or  / twilight sleep / , the prolongation of labour pains in  / advanced gravidancy /  by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of  / sepsis /  to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes,  / involution of the womb /  consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _ / Sturzgeburt / ,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the  / catamenic period /  or of  / consanguineous /  parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity  / which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece /  with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,  / supernumerary digits / , negro's inkle,  / strawberry mark and portwine stain /  were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame  / Grissel Steevens /  was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the  / Caledonian envoy /  and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the  / Minotaur /  which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an  / allocution /  from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance  / forbidding man to put asunder /   / what God has joined. / But Malachias' tale /  began to freeze them with horror.  / He conjured up the scene before them. /  The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me.  / Tare and ages / , what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of  / a soulth or a bullawurrus / ? My hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of  / Mananaun / ! The sage repeated: _ / Lex talionis / _. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs.  / The black panther /  was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted.  / Murderer's ground. / What is the age /  of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied  / baisemoins / . The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob's pipe after like labours in the paternal  / ingle /  (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie!  / Bridie Kelly / ! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath 'twas done but--hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what  / Leopold was for Rudolph. / The voices blend /  and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.  / She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. /   / They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. /  Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the  / lancinating /  lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the  / bulls of Bashan /  and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea,  / _Lacus Mortis_ / . Ominous revengeful  / zodiacal host / ! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun. / Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate  / antelucan /  hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon  / the forehead of Taurus. / Francis was reminding /  Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee's time. He asked about  / Glaucon / ,  / Alcibiades / ,  / Pisistratus / . Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of  / Lethe /  will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I,  / Bous Stephanoumenos / ,  / bullockbefriending bard / , am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his  / gadding /  hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call  / your genius father / . All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient won't. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant ( / Lalage /  were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos  / from the second constellation. / However, as a matter of fact /  though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of  / number one Bass /  bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place. / The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the  / Mull of Galloway / . There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of  / Lafayette /  has limned for  / ages yet to come. / It had better be stated /  here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' ( / Div. Scep / .) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom ( / Pubb. Canv. / ) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of  / Empedocles of Trinacria /  that the  / right ovary /  (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _ / nisus formativus / _ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _ / succubitus felix / _ of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan ( / Hyg. et Eug. Doc. / ) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he  / alleged / , and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed  / scorbutic /  cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified  / duenna / s--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.  / Kalipedia / , he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses  / forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare /  to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch ( / Bacc. Arith. / ) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after  / succumbs unaccountably /  in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with  / pluterperfect /  imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of  / staggering bob / , reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne ( / Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I. / ) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone  / in which it was delivered. / Meanwhile the skill and patience /  of the physician had brought about a happy _ / accouchement / ._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear  / Doady /  there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war,  / lord Bobs of Waterford /  and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. And so time wags on: but  / father Cronion /  has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have  / fought the good fight /  and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand.  / Well done / , thou  / good and faithful servant! / There are sins /  or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while  / timbrel /  and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past,  / silent, remote, reproachful. / The stranger still regarded /  on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as  / fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny /  and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in  / linseywoolsey /  (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the PIAZZETTA giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_ / alles Vergangliche / _)  / in her glad look. / Mark this farther /  and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the  / utterance of the word. / Burke's! /  outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel,  / jackanapes / , welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants,  / bilbo / s, Panama hats and scabbards,  / Zermatt alpenstocks /  and what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor.  / Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee? / The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _ / coelum / ._ God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.

Others appear almost furtively and are only discovered 50 years later, like MOBY DICK or Mendel's great essay on genetics. The PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA entered our space-time continuum almost as unobtrusively as a cat-burglar creeping over a windowsill. / In 1968, virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book. In 1970, hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking the identity of the mysterious author, Malaclypse the Younger. Rumors swept across the continent, from New York to Los Angeles, from Seattle to St. Joe. Malaclypse was actually Alan Watts, one heard. No, said another legend -- the PRINCIPIA was actually the work of the Sufi Order. A third, very intriguing myth held that Malaclypse was a pen-name for Richard M. Nixon, who had allegedly composed the PRINCIPIA during a few moments of lucidity. I enjoyed each of these yarns and did my part to help spread them. I was also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that I had actually written the whole thing myself during an acid trip. / The legendry, the mystery, the cult grew slowly. By the mid-1970's, thousands of people, some as far off as Hong Kong and Australia, were talking about the PRINCIPIA, and since the original was out of print by then, xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and there. / When the ILLUMINATUS trilogy appeared in 1975, my co-author, Bob Shea, and I both received hundreds of letters from people intrigued by the quotes from the PRINCIPIA with which we had decorated the heads of several chapters. Many, who had already heard of the PRINCIPIA or seen copies, asked if Shea and I had written it, or if we had copies available. Others wrote to ask if it were real, or just something we had invented the way H.P. Lovecraft invented the NECRONOMICON. We answered according to our moods, sometimes telling the truth, sometimes spreading the most Godawful lies and myths we could devise fnord. / Why not? We felt that this book was a true Classic (literatus immortalis) and, since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet discovered it, the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage the mythology and the controversy about it. Increasingly, people wrote to ask me if Timothy Leary had written it, and I almost always told them he had, except on Fridays when I am more whimsical, in which case I told them it had been transmitted by a canine intelligence -- vast, cool, and unsympathic -- from the Dog Star, Sirius. / Now, at last, the truth can be told. / Actually, the PRINCIPIA is the work of a time-travelling anthropologist from the 23rd Century. He is currently passing among us as a computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Gregory Hill. He has also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic poetry, under another pen-name, and in the 18th Century was the mysterious Man in Black who gave Jefferson the design for the Great Seal of the United States. / I have it on good authority that he is one of the most accomplished time-travelers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many times in the past, using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias, Emperor Norton, Count Cagliostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc. Whenever I question him about this, he grows very evasive and attempts to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th Century Earthman and that all my ideas about his extra- terrrestrial and extratemporal origin and delusions. Hah! I am not that easily deceived.

Indeed do many things come to pass. / HBT; The Book of Predictions, Chap. 19 / THE BIRTH OF THE ERISIAN MOVEMENT / The Revelation / Just prior to the decade of the nineteen-sixties, when Sputnik was alone and new, and about the time that Ken Kesey took his first acid trip as a medical volunteer; before underground newspapers, Viet Nam, and talk of a second American Revolution; in the comparative quiet of the late nineteen- fifties, just before the idea of RENAISSANCE became relevant.... / Two young Californians, known later as Omar Ravenhurst and Malaclypse the Younger, were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the world's problems. /  This particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and they were complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt in their respective lives. ""Solve the problem of discord,"" said one, ""and all other problems will vanish."" ""Indeed,"" said the other, ""chaos and strife are the roots of all confusion."" / First I Must Sprinkle You With Fairy Dust / Suddenly the place became devoid of light. Then an utter silence enveloped them, and a great stillness was felt. Then came a blinding flash of intense light, as though their very psyches had gone nova. Then vision returned. / The two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several minutes. They looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like statues in a variety of comic positions, and that a bowling ball was steadfastly anchored to the floor only inches from the pins that it had been sent to scatter. The two looked at each other, totally unable to account for the phenomenon. The condition was one of suspension, and one noticed that the clock had stopped. / [Marginalia; No Girdle Ever Cured a Pregnancy] / There walked into the room a chimpanzee, shaggy and grey about the muzzle, yet upright to his full five feet, and poised with natural majesty. He carried a scroll and walked to the young men. / ""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""why does Pickering's Moon go about in reverse orbit? Gentlemen, there are nipples on your chests; do you give milk? And what, pray tell, Gentlemen, is to be done about Heisenberg's Law?"" He paused. ""SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS CONFUSION HERE!"" / And with that he revealed his scroll. It was a diagram, like a yin- yang with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other. And then he exploded and the two lost consciousness. / ERIS - Goddess of Chaos, Discord & Confusion / They awoke to the sound of pins clattering, and found the bowlers engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee. It was apparant that their experience had been private. / They discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory the chimpanzee's diagram. Over the next five days they searched libraries to find the significance of it, but were disappointed to uncover only references to Taoism, the Korean flag, and Technocracy. It was not until they traced the Greek writing on the apple that they discovered the ancient Goddess known to the Greeks as Eris and to the Romans as Discordia. This was on the fifth night, and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity itself, and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes. Pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair, and rainbows manifested and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle voice: / I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness left man, that he might develop himself. I return to find this development approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding. / You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your vision is restricted, your movements are clumsy and painful, your skin is bruised, and your spirit is broiled in the sun. / I am chaos. /  I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. /  I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free. / During the next months they studied philosophies and theologies, and learned that Eris or Discordia was primarily feared by the ancients as being disruptive. Indeed, the very concept of chaos was still considered equivalent to strife and treated as a negative. ""No wonder things are all screwed up,"" they concluded, ""they have got it all backwards.""  / They found that the principle of disorder was every much as significant as the principle of order. / With this in mind, they studied the strange yin-yang. During a meditation one afternoon, a voice came to them: / It is called the Sacred  / Chao / . I appoint you Keepers of It. Therein you will find anything you like. Speak of Me as Discord, to show contrast to the pentagon. Tell constricted mankind that there are no rules, unless they choose to invent rules. Keep close the words of Syadasti: 'TIS AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO MINDS.  / And remember that there is no tyranny in the State of Confusion / . For further information, consult your pineal gland. / ""What is this?"" mumbled one to the other, ""A religion based on The Goddess of Confusion? It is utter madness!"" / And with those words, each looked at the other in absolute awe. Omar began to giggle. Mal began to laugh. Omar began to jump up and down. Mal was hooting and hollering to beat all hell. And amid squeals of mirth and with tears on their cheeks, each appointed the other to be high priest of his own madness, and together they declared themselves to be a society of Discordia, for what ever that may turn out to be. / ""There are trivial truths & there are great truths.

Actually, most women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly dagger in their bosoms. / Her geneology is from the Greeks and is utterly confused. Either She was the twin of Ares and the daughter of Zeus and Hera; or She was the daughter of Nyx, goddess of night (who was either the daughter or wife of Chaos, or both), and Nyx's brother, Erebus, and whose brothers and sisters include Death, Doom, Mockery, and Friendship. And that She begat Forgetfullness, Quarrels, Lies, and a bunch of gods and goddesses like that. / One day Mal-2 consulted his Pineal Gland* and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. ""They were,"" She added, ""victims of indigestion, you know."" / Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious.

And they started fighting, and they started throwing punch all over the place and everything. / Finally Zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must be selected, which was a reasonable suggestion, and all agreed. He sent them to a shepherd of Troy, whose name was Paris because his mother had had a lot of gaul and had married a Frenchman; but each of the sneaky goddesses tried to outwit the others by going early and offering a bribe to Paris. / Athena offered him Heroic War Victories, Hera offered him Great Wealth, and Aphrodite offered him the Most Beautiful Woman on Earth. Being a healthy young Trojan lad, Paris promptly accepted Aphrodite's bribe and she got the apple and he got screwed. / As she had promised, she maneuvered earthly happenings so that Paris could have Helen (the Helen) then living with her husband Menelaus, King of Sparta. Anyway, everyone knows that the Trojan War followed when Sparta demanded their Queen back and that the Trojan War is said to be The First War among men. / And so we suffer because of the Original Snub.

Dr. Hypocrates Magoun, P.P. POEE PRIEST, Okinawa Cabal / When Hypoc was through meditating with St. Gulik, he went there into the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in his endeavor, he found that there was some old tea in a pan left standing from the night before, when he had in his weakness forgot about its making and had let it sit steeping for 24 hours. It was dark and murky and it was Hypoc's intention to use this old tea by diluting it with water. And again in his weakness, chose without further consideration and plunged into the physical labor of the preparations. It was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of that trip, he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head saying ""it is bitter tea that involves you so."" Hypoc heard the voice, but the struggle inside intensified, and the pattern, previously established with the physical laboring and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded, continued to exert their influence and Hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied the voice. / And again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the task, and Lo as the voice had predicted, the tea was bitter. / ""The Five Laws have root in awareness."" / --Che Fung (Ezra Pound, Canto 85) / The Hell Law says that Hell is reserved exclusively for them that believe in / it.

So he put his shovel to one side and bedded himself down on the sand, using as a pillow a Golden Chest he had uncovered on the first day of his labors. / Omar slept. / On the fifth day of his sleeping, Lord Omar fell into a Trance, and there came to him in the Trance a Dream, and there came to him in the Dream a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Grove wherein was hidden a Golden Chest. / And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and lift the Stash, that ye may come to own it and, owning it, share it and, sharing it, love in it and, loving in it, dwell in it and, dwelling in the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods. / But Omar lamented, saying unto the Angel : What is this shit, man? What care I for the Word and Sayings? What care I for the Inspiration of all men? Wherein does it profit a man to be a Scribe to the Gods when the Scribes of the Governments do nothing, yet are paid better wages? / And, lo, the Angel waxed in anger and Omar was stricken to the Ground by an Invisible Hand and did not arise for five days and five nights. / And it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt, and in his Dream he had a Vision, and in this Vision there came unto him a Messenger of Our Lady who entrusted to him a Rigoletto cigar box containing many filing cards, some of them in packs with rubber bands around, and upon these cards were sometimes written verses, while upon others nothing was written. / Thereupon the Angel Commanded to Lord: Take ye this Honest Book of Truth to thine bosom and cherish it. Carry it forth into The Land and Lay it before Kings of Nations and Collectors of Garbage. Preach from it unto the Righteous, that they may renounce their ways and repent. / CONVENTIONAL CHAOS / GREYFACE / In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted the ways of Serious Order. ""Look at all the order around you,"" he said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it. / It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway, Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own. / The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip. Man has been on a bad trip for a long time now. / It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE. / Bullshit makes the flowers / grow & that's beautiful. / Climb into the Chao with a friend or two / And follow the Way it carries you, / Adrift like a Lunatic Lifeboat Crew / Over the Waves in whatever you do. / (HBT; The Book of Advise, 1:3) / [graphic deleted... if you wanna see it, READ THE BOOK] / Meanwhile, at the Chinese laundromat... / DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, ""COSMOLOGY""* / THE BOOK OF UTERUS / from the Honest Book of Truth revealed to Lord Omar / Before the beginning was the Nonexistent Chao, balanced in Oblivion by the Perfect Counterpushpull of the Hodge and the Podge. / Whereupon, by an Act of Happenstance, the Hodge began gradually to overpower the Podge -- and the Primal Chaos thereby came to be. / So in the beginning was the Primal Chaos, balanced on the Edge of Oblivion by the Perfect Counterpullpush of the Podge and the Hodge. / Whereupon, by the Law of Negative Reversal,** the Podge swiftly underpowered the Hodge and Everything broke loose. / And therein emerged the Active Force of Discord, the Subtle Manifestation of the Nonexistent Chao, to guide Everything along the Path back to Oblivion - that it might not become lost among Precepts of Order in the Region of Thud. / Forasmuch as it was Active, the Force of Discord entered the State of Confusion, wherein It copulated with the Queen and begat ERIS, Our Lady of Discord and Gross Manifestation of the Nonexistent Chao. / And under Eris Confusion became established, and was hence called Bureaucracy; while over Bureaucracy Eris became established, and was hence called Discordia. / By the by it came to pass that the Establishment of Bureaucracy perished in a paper shortage. / Thus it was, in accord with the Law of Laws. / During and after the Fall of the Establishment of Bureaucracy was the Aftermath, an Age of Disorder in which calculation, computations, and reckonings were put away by the Children of Eris in Acceptance and Preparation for the Return to Oblivion to be followed by a Repetition of the Universal Absurdity.

The Orders are composed of persons all hung up on authority, security and control; i.e., they are blinded by the Aneristic Illusion. They do not know that they belong to Orders of Discordia. But we know. / The Military Order of THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE SIDED TEMPLE. This is for all the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world. / The Political Order of THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL. This is reserved for lawmakers, censors, and like ilk. / The Academic Order of THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP. They commonly inhabit schools and universities, and dominate many of them. / The Social Order of THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS. This is mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional military, political, academic and sacred Orders. / The Sacred Order of THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE. Not much is known about the D.L., but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by Greyface himself. It is known that they now have absolute domination over all organized churches in the world. It is also believed that they have been costuming cabbages and passing them off as human beings. / A person belonging to one or more Order is just as likely to carry a flag of the counter-establishment as the flag of the establishment-- just as long as it is a flag. / Don't let THEM immanentize the Eschaton. / HIP-2-3-4, HIP-2-3-4 / Go To Your Left-Right.... / THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM BERGAN EVANS / ON NORBERT WEINER, NUCLEAR PHYSICIST / The second concept Wiener has to establish is that of entropy. Probability is a mathematical concept, coming from statistics. Entropy comes from physics. It is the assertion-- established logically and experimentally-- that the universe, by its nature, is ""running down"", moving toward a state of inert uniformity devoid of form, matter, hierarchy or differentiation. / That is, in any given situation, less organization, more chaos, is overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order. / The tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed in the second law of thermodynamics-- perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought. / It applies however, to a closed system, to something that is an isolated whole, not just a part. Within such systems there may be parts, which draw their energy from the whole, that are moving at least temporarily, in the opposite direction; in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing. / The whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current are called ""enclaves"". And one of them is life, especially human life, which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards increased order. / IF THE TELEPHONE RINGS TODAY..... WATER IT! / -Rev. Thomas, Gnostic / N.Y.C. Cabal / Personal / PLANETARY Pi, which I discovered, is 61. It's a Time-Energy relationship existing between sun and inner plants and I use it in arriving at many facts unknown to science. For example, multiply nude earth's circumference 24,902.20656 by 61 and you get the distance of moon's orbit around the earth. This is slightly less than the actual distance because we have not yet considered earth's atmosphere. So be it.

What is your Purpose in Life, anyway?"" / Munching the tasty grass, The Sacred Chao replied ""MU"".* / Upon hearing this, absolutely nobody was enlightened. Primarily because nobody could understand Chinese. / * ""MU"" is the Chinese ideogram for NO-THING / TAO FA TSU-DAN                                      FIND PEACE WITH A / CONTENTED CHAO / THE SACRED CHAO / THE SACRED CHAO is the key to illumination. Devised by the Apostle Hung Mung in ancient China, it was modified and popularized by the Taoists and is sometimes called the YIN-YANG. The Sacred Chao is not the Yin-Yang of the Taoists. It is the HODGE-PODGE of the Erisians. And, instead of a Podge spot on the Hodge side, it has a PENTAGON which symbolizes the ANERISTIC PRINCIPLE, and instead of a Hodge spot on the Podge side, it depicts the GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORDIA to symbolize the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE. / The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about absolutely anything, and more! It even symbolizes everything not worth knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the Hodge-Podge. / HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS. / If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it. / The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making. / With our concept making apparatus called ""mind"" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The ideas-about- reality are mistakenly labeled ""reality"" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see ""reality"" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept. / We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle. / Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other. / DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like ""relation"", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is ""absence of female-ness"", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE. / The belief that ""order is true"" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the ERISTIC ILLUSION. / The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered. / Reality is the original Rorschach. / Verily! So much for all that. / The words of the Foolish and those of the Wise / Are not far apart in Discordian Eyes. / (HBT; The Book of Advise, 2:1) / The PODGE of the Sacred Chao is symbolized as The Golden Apple of Discordia, which represents the Eristic Principle of Disorder. The writing on it, ""KALLISTI"" is Greek for ""TO THE PRETTIEST ONE"" and refers to an old myth about The Goddess. But the Greeks had only a limited understanding of Disorder, and thought it to be a negative principle. / The Pentagon represents the Aneristic Principle of Order and symbolizes the HODGE. The Pentagon has several references; for one, it can be taken to represent geometry, one of the earliest studies of formal order to reach elaborate development;* for another, it specifically accords with THE LAW OF FIVES. / THE TRUTH IS FIVE BUT MEN HAVE ONLY ONE NAME FOR IT. / -Patamunzo Lingananda / It is also the shape of the United States Military Headquarters, the Pentagon Building, a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket order resting on a firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting into dazzling disorder; and this building is one of our more cherished Erisian Shrines. Also it so happens that in times of medieval magic, the pentagon was the generic symbol for werewolves, but this reference is not particularly intended and it should be noted that the Erisian Movement does not discriminate against werewolves-- our membership roster is open to persons of all races, national origins and hobbies. / ____________________________________ / * The Greek geometrician PYTHAGORAS, however, was not a typical aneristic personality. He was what we call an EXPLODED ANERISTIC and an AVATAR. We call him Archangle Pythagoras. / 5.  Hung Mung slapped his buttocks, hopped about, and shook his head, saying / ""I do not know! I do not know!"" / HBT; The Book of Gooks, Chap. 1 / BRUNSWICK SHRINE / In the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier there lives a bowling alley, and within this very place, in the Year of Our Lady of Discord 3125 (1959*), Eris revealed Herself to The Golden Apple Corps for the first time. / In honor of this Incredible Event, this Holy Place is revered as a Shrine by all Erisians. Once every five years, the Golden Apple Corps plans a Pilgrimage to Brunswick Shrine as an act of Devotion, and therein to partake of No Hot Dog Buns, and ruminate a bit about It All. / It is written that when The Corps returns to The Shrine for the fifth time five times over, than shall the world come to an end: / IMPENDING DOOM HAS ARRIVED / And Five Days Prior to This Occasion The Apostle The Elder / Malaclypse Shall Walk the Streets of Whittier Bearing a Sign / for All Literates to Read thereof: ""DOOM"", as a Warning of / Forthcoming Doom to All Men Impending. And He Shall Signal / This Event by Seeking the Poor and Distributing to Them Precious / MAO BUTTONS and Whittier Shall be Known as The Region of Thud / for These Five Days. / As a public service to all mankind and civilization in general, and to us in particular, the Golden Apple Corps has concluded that planning such a Pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get around to actually going. / ___________________________________ / * Or maybe it was 1958, I forget. / STARBUCK'S PEBBLES                                     Which / Is / Real? / * / *               * / *       * / Do these 5 pebbles REALLY form a pentagon? / [note: they were pebbles, originally..try doing ASCII pebbles -DtC] Those biased by the Aneristic Illusion would say yes.

RAMPANT PANCREAS, tRRoCR(a)pttM; Colorado Encrustation / Brother Ram, / Your acute observation that ERIS spelled backwards is SIRE, and your inference to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here, have brought me to some observations of my own. / ERIS spelled fore-part-aft-wards is RISE. And spelled inside out is REIS, which is a unit of money, albeit Portugese-Brazilian and no longer in use. >From this it may be concluded that Eris has usurped Eros (god of erotic love) in the eyes of those who read backwards; which obviously made Eros sorE. Then She apparently embezzeled the Olympian Treasury and went to Brazil; whereupon She opened a chain of whorehouses (which certainly would get a rise from the male population). I figure it to be this in particular because MADAM reads the same forwards and backwards. And further, it is a term of great respect, similar to SIRE. / And so thank you for your insight, it may well be the clue to the mystery of just where Eris has been fucking around for 3125 years. / FIVE TONS OF FLAX! / -><-    Mal-2 / Not for Circulation! / KALLISTI        HAIL ERIS             ALL HAIL DISCORDIA / safeguard this letter, it may be an IMPORTANT DOCUMENT / Form No.: O.D.D. IIb/ii.1-37D.VVM:3134 / DOGMA III - HISTORY #2, ""COSMOGONY"" / which is not the same as / DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, ""COSMOLOGY"" (Book of Uterus) / In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the smaller) was that of BEING, named ERIS, and one (the larger) was of NON- BEING, named ANERIS. (To this day, the fundamental truth that Aneris is the larger is apparent to all who compare the great number of things that do not exist with the comparatively small number of things that do exist.) / Eris had been born pregnant, and after 55 years (Goddesses have an unusually long gestation period-- longer even than elephants), Her pregnancy bore the fruits of many things. These things were composed of the Five Basic Elements, SWEET, BOOM, PUNGENT, PRICKLE, and ORANGE. Aneris, however, had been created sterile. When she saw Eris enjoying Herself so greatly with all of the existent things She had borne, Aneris became jealous and finally one day she stole some existent things and changed them into non- existent things and claimed them as her own children. This deeply hurt Eris, who felt that Her sister was unjust (being so much larger anyway) to deny Her her small joy. And so She made herself swell again to bear more things. And She swore that no matter how many of her begotten that Aneris would steal, She would beget more. And, in return, Aneris swore that no matter how many existent things Eris brought forth, she would eventually find them and turn them into non-existent things for her own. (And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very manner.) / At first, the things brought forth by Eris were in a state of chaos and went in every which way, but by the by She began playing with them and ordered some of them just to see what would happen. Some pretty things arose from this play and for the next five zillion years She amused Herself by creating order. And so She grouped some things with others and some groups with others, and big groups with little groups, and all combinations until She had many grand schemes which delighted Her. / Engrossed in establishing order, She finally one day noticed disorder (previously not apparent because everything was chaos). There were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not. / ""Hah,"" She thought, ""Here shall be a new game."" / And She taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest games, and to take turns amusing each other. She named the side of disorder after Herself, ""ERISTIC"" because Being is anarchic. And then, in a mood of sympathy for Her lonely sister, She named the other side ""ANERISTIC"" which flattered Aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them. / Now all of this time, Void was somewhat disturbed. He felt unsatisfied for he had created only physical existence and physical non- existence, and had neglected the spiritual. As he contemplated this, a great Quiet was caused and he went into a state of Deep Sleep which lasted for 5 eras. At the end of this ordeal, he begat a brother to Eris and Aneris, that of SPIRITUALITY, who had no name at all. / When the sisters heard this, they both confronted Void and pleaded that he not forget them, his First Born. And so Void decreed thus: / That this brother, having no form, was to reside with Aneris in Non-Being and then to leave her and, so that he might play with order and disorder, reside with Eris in Being. But Eris became filled with sorrow when She heard this and then began to weep. / ""Why are you despondent?"" demanded Void, ""Your new brother will have his share with you."" ""But Father, Aneris and I have been arguing, and she will take him from me when she discovers him, and cause him to return to Non- Being."" ""I see,""replied Void, ""Then I decree the following: / ""When your brother leaves the residence of Being, he shall not reside again in Non-Being, but shall return to Me, Void, from whence he came. You girls may bicker as you wish, but My son is your Brother and We are all of Myself."" / And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is that we play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder them, and so it shall be that non-existence shall take us back from existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to Void, like a tired child home from a very wild circus. / ""Everything is true - Everything is permissible!""            -><- / -Hassan i Sabbah / There is serenity in Chaos. / Seek ye the Eye of the Hurricane. / A POEE MYSTEREE RITE - THE SRI SYADASTIAN CHANT / Written, in some sense, by Mal-2 / Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted.

When magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavours, then they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore gain more effective magic.

If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to N-1,each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time. Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows that N=2K+1, an odd number.""

But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder. / The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder.

And / please stop bothering us with your incessant letters! / Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you / are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been / fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley / slave who ascended to the Throne of Valusia.  Revived by Pelias of Koth, / circa 10,000 B.C.  Possibly it was he who taught the inner-teachings to / Conan of Cimmeria after Conan became King of Aquilonia.  First brought to / the western hemisphere by Conan and taught to Mayan priesthood (Conan is / Quetzlcoatl).  That was 4 Ahua, 8 Cumhu, Mayan date.  Revived by Abdul / Alhazred in his infamous Al Azif, circa 800 A.D.  (Al Azif translated into / Latin by Olaus Wormius, 1132 A.D., as The Necronomicon.)  In 1090 A.D. was / the founding of The Ismaelian Sect (Hashishim) by Hassan i Sabbah, with / secret teachings based on Alhazred, Pelias and Kull.  Founding of the / Illuminated Ones of Bavaria, by Adam Weishaupt, on May 1, 1776.  He based it / on the others.  Weishaupt brought it to the United States during the period / that he was impersonating George Washington; and it was he who was the Man / in Black who gave the design for The Great Seal to Jefferson in the garden / that night.  The Illuminated tradition is now, of course, in the hands of / The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (A.I.S.B.), headquartered here in / the United States. / Our teachings are not, need I remind you, available for publication. / No harm, though, in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in / Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, Burroughs Nova Express, the King James translation / of the Holy Bible (though not the Latin or Hebrew), and The Blue Book.  Not / to speak of Ben Franklin's private papers (!), but we are still suppressing / those. / Considering current developments--you know the ones I speak of--it / has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations.  Your / publication is timely, so mention that in addition to the old fronts like / the Masons, the Rothchild Banks, and the Federal Reserve System, we now have / significant control of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (since Hoover / died last year, but that is still secret), the Students for a Democratic / Society, the Communist Party USA, the American Anarchist Assn., the Junior / Chamber of Commerce, the Black Lotus Society, the Republican Party, the John / Dillinger Die For You Society, and the Camp Fire Girls.  It is still useful / to continue the sham of the Birchers that we are seeking world domination; / so do not reveal that political and economic control was generally complete / several generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a / while until civilization advances sufficiently for phase five. / In fact you might still push Vennard's The Federal Reserve Hoax: / ""Since the Babylonian Captivity there has existed a determined, behind-the- / scenes under-the-table, atheistic, satanic, anti-Christian force--worshipers / of Mamon--whose undying purpose is world control through the control of / Money.  July 1, 1776 (correct that to May 1st, Vennard can't get anything / right) the Serpent raised its head in the under-ground secret society known / as the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt.  There is considerable / documentary evidence to prove all revolutions, wars, depressions, strikes / and chaos stem from this source."" Etc., etc., you know the stuff. / The general location of our US HQ, incidentally, has been nearly / exposed; and so we will be moving for the first time this century (what a / drag!).  If you want, you can reveal that it is located deep in the / labyrinth of sewers beneath Dealy Plaza in Dallas, and is presided over by / The Dealy Lama.  Inclosed are some plans for several new potential / locations.  Please review and add any comments you feel pertinent, / especially regarding the Eristic propensity of the Pentagon site. / Oh, and we have some good news for you, Brother Mal!  You know that / Zambian cybernetics genius who joined us?  Well, he has secretly co- / ordinated the FBI computers with the Zurich System and our theoriticians are / in ecstasy over the new information coming out.  Look, if you people out / there can keep from blowing yourselves up for only two more generations, / then we will finally have it.  After 20,000 years, Kull's dream will be / realized!  We can hardly believe it.  But the outcome is certain, given the / time.  Our grandchildren, Mal!  If civilization makes it through this / crises, our grandchildren will live in a world of authentic freedom and / authentic harmony and authentic satisfaction.  I hope I'm alive to see it, / Mal, success is in our grasp.  Twenty thousand years....! / Ah, I get spaced just thinking about it.  Good luck on the / Principia. / Ewige Blumenkraft!

""I didn't trouble my head about getting pretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll tell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all you'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday school. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things you've been wearing."" / ""Oh, I AM grateful,"" protested Anne. ""But I'd be ever so much gratefuller if—if you'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves. Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves."" / ""Well, you'll have to do without your thrill. I hadn't any material to waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things anyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones."" / ""But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself,"" persisted Anne mournfully.""Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your closet, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got a quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you'll go to Sunday school tomorrow,"" said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon. / Anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses. / ""I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,"" she whispered disconsolately. ""I prayed for one, but I didn't much expect it on that account. I didn't suppose God would have time to bother about a little orphan girl's dress. I knew I'd just have to depend on Marilla for it. Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of snow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves."" / The next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from going to Sunday-school with Anne. / ""You'll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,"" she said. ""She'll see that you get into the right class. Now, mind you behave yourself properly. Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to show you our pew. Here's a cent for collection. Don't stare at people and don't fidget. I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home."" / Anne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure. Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers. The latter, however, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped gaily down the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly. / When she had reached Mrs. Lynde's house she found that lady gone. Nothing daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone. In the porch she found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about Anne. Mrs. Lynde said she had an awful temper; Jerry Buote, the hired boy at Green Gables, said she talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers like a crazy girl. They looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies. Nobody made any friendly advances, then or later on when the opening exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss Rogerson's class. / Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she thought ought to answer the question. She looked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla's drilling, answered promptly; but it may be questioned if she understood very much about either question or answer. / She did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable; every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves. / ""Well, how did you like Sunday school?"" Marilla wanted to know when Anne came home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane, so Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time. / ""I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid."" / ""Anne Shirley!"" said Marilla rebukingly. / Anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny's leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.""They might have been lonesome while I was away,"" she explained. ""And now about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs. Lynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with a lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things."" / ""You shouldn't have done anything of the sort. You should have listened to Mr. Bell."" / ""But he wasn't talking to me,"" protested Anne. ""He was talking to God and he didn't seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think he thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them, 'way, 'way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a beautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, 'Thank you for it, God,' two or three times."" / ""Not out loud, I hope,"" said Marilla anxiously. / ""Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson's class. There were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried to imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn't. Why couldn't I? It was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs."" / ""You shouldn't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school. You should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it."" / ""Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so many. I don't think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were lots I wanted to ask her, but I didn't like to because I didn't think she was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn't, but I could recite, 'The Dog at His Master's Grave' if she liked. That's in the Third Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry, but it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it wouldn't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are two lines in particular that just thrill me. / ""'Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell / In Midian's evil day.' / ""I don't know what 'squadrons' means nor 'Midian,' either, but it sounds SO tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it. I'll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson—because Mrs. Lynde was too far away—to show me your pew. I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a minister I'd pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn't think he was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he hasn't enough imagination. I didn't listen to him very much. I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things."" / Marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but she was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had said, especially about the minister's sermons and Mr. Bell's prayers, were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for years, but had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that those secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity.","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'N/A', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Literature']}"

The Gulf Coastal Plains in the west is where you'll hear rock, blues and soul.  The Nashville Basin in central Tennessee is where you'll hear the evolution of country music. The Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and Unaka Mountains region in the east is where you'll hear bluegrass and string band music. We'll cover all of them in this article, working from west to east / . / But before we get to these topics, here are some of the best tribute songs to the state itself: / Johnny Cash's  / ""Tennessee"" / Jimmy Martin's  / ""Tennessee"" / John Hiatt's  / ""Tennessee Plates"" / Jessica Andrews'  / ""James Dean In Tennessee"" / Alabama's  / ""Dixieland Delight"" / Brad Paisley's  / ""Southern Comfort Zone"" / Steve Earle's  / ""Copperhead Road"" / Old Crow Medicine Show's  / ""Wagon Wheel"" / Dolly Parton's  / ""My Tennessee Mountain Home"" / Music of the Gulf Coastal Plains - / The Elvis Presley Phenomenon / Elvis Presley was rock and roll’s first big star, and his rise to fame marked a major change in American culture.  / He was a white man who sang country blues, r&b and rockabilly, all of it laced with a gospel sound. /  Perhaps even more than  / James Dean / , he exuded a natural sexuality that shaped the thinking of American youth about what was cool.  / He was vilified by the older generation as vulgar and a bad influence on their children / , but  / he was the beginning of a movement that changed our culture / . / ""Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail."" /  -   / Bob Dylan / Born on 8 January 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley was the son of Gladys and Vernon Presley, a seamstress and a truck driver. Elvis’ twin brother, Jesse Garon, was stillborn, and Elvis grew up an only child. When he was three, his father served an eight-month prison term for writing bad checks, and afterward Vernon Presley’s employment was erratic, keeping the family just above homelessness / . / In 1945, Presley won second prize at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Diary Show for his rendition of  / Red Foley / ’s  / “Old Shep” / .  In 1948 the family moved to Memphis, and while attending L.C. Humes High School there, Presley spent much of his time in the black section of town, and especially on Beale Street watching and listening to bluesmen like  / Furry Lewis /  and  / B.B. King / . / After high school graduation in 1953, he thought he'd become a truck driver like his father, but he couldn't let go of his love of music. He recorded several songs at the  / Memphis Recording Service / , a sideline business Sam Phillips set up in his  / Sun Records /  studio that allowed anyone to record a 10-inch acetate for four dollars / . / The Sun Sessions / Sam Phillips noticed Presley, and called him in the  spring of 1954 to record a song for Sun Records. Although that session didn't go well, Phillips thought he'd found something in Presley:  / “a white man with the Negro sound and the Negro feel"" / . Phillips worked with Presley to develop that style and brought guitarist  / Scotty Moore /  and bassist  / Bill Black /  into the studio to rehearse with him for several months.  On the 5th of July 1954, they recorded  / “Blue Moon of Kentucky” /  and  / “That’s All Right, Mama"" / . The Memphis response was huge and it became his first local hit. Presley even made an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville on September 25th / . / Left to right: Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and (seated) Elvis Presley, 1955.  They all recorded for Sun Records at the same time / . / By October 1954, Presley had debuted on the  / Louisiana Hayride / , a popular radio program. He made his television debut on the television version of Hayride in March 1955. Meanwhile,  / “Good Rockin’ Tonight” /  became a hit in Memphis / . / Colonel Tom Parker /  entered Presley’s life in 1955, helping Presley make some tour arrangements. Presley trusted Parker because Parker managed  / Hank Snow / , and  / Presley's mother had great respect for Snow. /   On May 13th, his song,  / “Baby, Let’s Play House” /  was released and climbed to No. 10 on the Country and Western charts / . / Elvis Hits the Big Time / In September 1955, Presley had his first No. 1 country hit, a version of Junior Parker’s  / “Mystery Train” / . By early 1956, he was becoming a national star.  / He and Parker went to Nashville and recorded his first songs for RCA /  (including  / “I Got a Woman” /  and  / “Heartbreak Hotel” / . In January 1956, Presley made his national television debut with six consecutive appearances on the  / Dorsey Brothers’ Stage Show / . In March, Presley signed a management agreement with Parker giving Parker 25% of Presley’s gross earnings,  / a deal that got even sweeter for Parker over time / . / Things started to snowball in 1956, when Parker got Presley appearances on the  / Milton Berle / ,  / Steve Allen / , and  / Ed Sullivan /  TV shows. By August, he began filming his first movie.  / Love Me Tender /  was a hit and that sparked a series of hit singles:  / “Blue Suede Shoes” / ,  / “Don’t Be Cruel” /  (with  / “Hound Dog” /  on the B-side) and  / “Love Me Tender” / . / In March 1957, Presley purchased Graceland, a former church that had been converted into a 23-room mansion. The next month,  / “All Shook Up” /  began an eight-week run at No. 1.   / He continued to make movies too / , and they helped sell records like  / “(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear” /  and  / “Jailhouse Rock” / . / In December 1957, Presley received his draft notice, and entered the U.S. Army in March, 1958. /  He took leave just a few months later to be with his mother, who died the day after he  arrived home in Memphis.  / Presley served the remainder of his two year obligation to the Army and was discharged in March, 1960 / . / During the Christmas holiday of 1960, Priscilla Beaulie visited Presley at Graceland, and moved in soon after.  She was 14 at the time. They were married in May 1967, after Priscilla turned 21.  They had their first and only child nine months later / . / ""Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been a Beatles."" /  -  / John Lennon / The Big Comeback / Music was changing fast by the mid 60s, and Presley started fading from the scene because of the  / ""British Invasion"" /  and the focus on live concerts by acts like  / The Beatles / , the  / Rolling Stones / ,  / The Who /  and others. Although he continued to make movies, they were received with less and less interest. Presley was becoming uncool and was in danger of becoming irrelevant / . / The solution was a TV special, and it became his big come-back vehicle. It took the form of what later became the  / MTV Unplugged series / . The idea started as a Christmas special, but people close to Presley argued against that, wanting something more engaging and personal. Director and producer  / Steve Binder /  noticed that Presley and his band members would blow-off steam during rehearsals by improvising blues and r&b throw aways.  / ""And that's when I really got the idea: Wouldn't it be great if I had a camera in here and they didn't know I was here?"" / . / Presley was concerned about doing a live performance, but Binder built his confidence by doing several live audience rehearsals and using  / Scotty Moore /  and  / D.J. Fontana / . He also put Priscilla and several of Presley's friends in the audience. On 27 June 1968, Presley took the stage for his first live perfor-mance in seven years. The result was four one-hour live shows, taped at NBC's Burbank studios. Presley sat and jammed with band mates for two shows, and the second two were done two nights later as small room stand-ups. Those sessions are often referred to as  / ""The Burbank Sessions"" / . / But by the early 70s, Presley’s personal life had become fodder for tabloid headlines. Priscilla left Elvis in February 1972, and on his birthday in 1973, he filed for divorce. Professionally, he reached his peak after the 1968 comeback. Although new hits were few ( / ""Suspicious Minds"" / ,  / ""In the Ghetto"" /  and  / ""Promised Land"" /  are three of only a handful),  / he was more popular than ever and his fan worship was turning into a personality cult. /   But he was plagued by self-doubt and poor management.  Starting in 1974, he repeatedly threatened to quit show business. He turned to drugs and became a virtual recluse. His abuse of prescription drugs increased during the last years of his life. Ironically, he remained devoutly spiritual, never drank alcohol, and publicly denounced drug use.  / He even  visited Richard Nixon at the White House to receive an honorary DEA badge / . / Towards the end, he gained weight, slept poorly, and his on-stage performances fell-off dramatically. Presley’s last live performance was on 25 June 1977, in Indianapolis. At the time, he was preoccupied by  / the impending publication of one of the tell-all books that would make public his drug abuse /  and obsession with firearms. The book came out on August 12th and  / on 16 August 1977, Presley was discovered dead in the bathroom of his home by girlfriend /   / Ginger Alden / . He was just 42 at the time. His death was blamed on congestive heart failure, but later investigation revealed that  / drug abuse was at least part of the cause of his death / . / Rockabilly Music / Rockabilly blends country and bluegrass with western swing, boogie-woogie and jump blues to deliver a hard-driving rhythm that's meant for dancing.  Rockabilly may have peaked in the mid 1950s, but it never really died.  There are many artists who continue the tradition today, like  / Imelda May / ,  / Brian Setzer /  and  / The Reverend Horton Heat / . / Here's a short list of some great rockabilly, arranged in chronological order from 1954 - 2014: / Elvis Presley's  / ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" / Jerry Lee Lewis'  / ""Whole Lotta Shakin'"" / Chuck Berry's  / ""Little Queenie"" / Eddie Cochran's  / ""Summertime Blues"" / Wanda Jackson's  / ""Let's Have a Party"" / The Del Lords'  / ""Shame on You"" / Link Wray's  / ""Good Good Lovin'"" / Willie Nile's  / ""She's So Cold"" / John Melencamp's  / ""Little Pink Houses"" / Keith Richards'  / ""I Could Have Stood You Up"" / Steve Earle's  / ""Guitar Town"" / Carl Perkins'  / ""Give Me Back My Job"" / Imelda May's  / ""Johnny Got a Boom-Boom"" / Devil's Daughters'  / ""Pass That Bottle"" / Joshua Scott Jones'  / ""Honk if You're Tonky"" / Brian Setzer's  / ""Let's Shake"" / Memphis Blues and R&B Music / Beale Street in Memphis has lured Mississippi blues players for over a hundred years. The earliest arrivals included  / Gus Cannon / ,  / Furry Lewis / ,  / Tommy Johnson / ,  / Mississippi John Hurt /  and  / Memphis Minnie / .  But it was  / W.C. Handy /  who made blues a noticed genre with songs like  / ""St. Louis Blues"" /  and  / ""Yellow Dog Blues"" / . / After WW2, Memphis became a hot spot for blues and soul recording with artists like  / Rufus Thomas / ,  / Junior Parker / ,  / B.B. King / , and  / Elvis Presley / .   / The mix of rural and urban musical traditions led to the creation of new blues styles, including the revolutionary new sounds of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. /  Riley King arrived from Indianola and soon became known as the “Beale Street Blues Boy”, a name he later shortened to B.B. King. Rufus Thomas helped King come into his own by featuring him in his shows.  Thomas and King were among the many Mississippi-born artists who recorded at Sam Phillips'  / Sun Records / . / The Memphis music scene went through some tough times in the late 1960s and 70s;  / the place became a virtual ghost town. /   But in 1966,  / Beale Street was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. /   In the late 70s, the City of Memphis bought nearly every property on a three block stretch of what had been the heart of the historic Beale Street blues district. In 1977, an act of  / the U.S. Congress declared Beale Street as the ""Home of the Blues"". /   The Beale Street Management Corporation rebuilt the entertainment district, and by the early 80s, a complete renovation was underway.  New clubs, restaurants and shops opened throughout the 80s and 90s, and by the turn of the century, Beale Street's comeback was complete / . / Today, Beale Street is bigger and better than ever.  The  blues traditions are promoted today by theCenter for Southern Folklore, the  / Memphis Blues Society /  and the Memphis-based  / Blues Foundation /   / and their annual International Blues Competition and Blues Music Awards / . / Here are some good examples of Memphis blues and r&b: / B.B. King's  / ""Everyday I Have the Blues"" / , / ""Riding with the King"" /  and  / ""When Love Comes to Town"" / Ry Cooder's  / ""Willie Brown Blues"" / Howlin' Wolf's  / ""Smokestack Lightning"" /  and  / ""Killing Floor"" / Bobby King & Terry Evan's  / ""Bald Head"" /  and  / ""Just a Little Bit"" / John Lee Hooker's  / ""Mama, You Got a Daughter"" / ,  / ""Crawlin' Kingsnake"" /  and  / ""One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer"" / Little Milton's  / ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" / Frank Stokes'  / ""Downtown Blues"" / Junior Parker's  / ""Mystery Train"" /  and  / ""Drivin' Wheel"" / Aretha Franklin's  / ""Respect"" /  and  / ""Chain of Fools"" / Johnny Rivers'  / ""Memphis, Tennessee"" / John Hiatt's  / ""Memphis in the Meantime"" / Memphis Soul Music / Soul music originated in Memphis.  / The roots of both blues and soul can be traced to the slave music of the 19th century, /  and both started a transformation with American urbanization after WW2. Soul became a  separate genre by 1960, and was brought to mainstream radio largely by the records made at  / Stax Records / ,  / Hi Records /  and  / Goldwax Records / .  Stax Records was the most famous of the soul studios because of artists like  / Booker T. and the MG’s / ,  / Sam and Dave / ,  / Isaac Hayes /  and  / Otis Redding. /   The soul genre declined in popularity during the disco era of the late 70s, but your can still hear its influence in other genres like motown, r&b, hip-hop, and even country / . / Here are some good examples of Memphis soul music: / Sam & Dave's  / ""Soul Man"" /  and  / ""Hold On, I'm Comin'"" / Bobby Bland's / ""(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"" / Booker T & the MG's  / ""Green Onions"" / Otis Redding's  / ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay"" /  and / ""These Arms of Mine"" / Rufus Thomas'  / ""Walkin' the Dog"" / Aretha Franklin's  / ""I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)"" / James Carr's  / ""The Dark End of the Street"" / This is page 1 of a 3 page article on the music of Tennessee.

DE CHARLUS AND OF ROBERT DE SAINT-LOUP — DINNER WITH BLOCH AND HIS FAMILY /    I had arrived at a state almost of complete indifference to Gilberte when, two years later, I went with my grandmother to Balbec. When I succumbed to the attraction of a strange face, when it was with the help of some other girl that I hoped to discover gothic cathedrals, the palaces and gardens of Italy, I said to myself sadly that this love of ours, in so far as it is love for one particular creature, is not perhaps a very real thing, since if the association of pleasant or unpleasant trains of thought can attach it for a time to a woman so as to make us believe that it has been inspired by her, in a necessary sequence of effect to cause, yet when we detach ourselves, deliberately or unconsciously, from those associations, this love, as though it were indeed a spontaneous thing and sprang from ourselves alone, will revive in order to bestow itself on another woman. At the time, however, of my departure for Balbec, and during the earlier part of my stay there, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often, our life being so careless of chronology, interpolating so many anachronisms in the sequence of our days, I lived still among those — far older days than yesterday or last week — in which I loved Gilberte. And at once not seeing her became as exquisite a torture to me as it had been then. The self that had loved her, which another self had already almost entirely supplanted, rose again in me, stimulated far more often by a trivial than by an important event. For instance, if I may anticipate for a moment my arrival in Normandy, I heard some one who passed me on the sea-front at Balbec refer to the ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and his family.’ Now, seeing that as yet I knew nothing of the influence which that family was to exercise over my life, this remark ought to have passed unheeded; instead, it gave me at once an acute twinge, which a self that had for the most part long since been outgrown in me felt at being parted from Gilberte. Because I had never given another thought to a conversation which Gilberte had had with her father in my hearing, in which allusion was made to the Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and to his family. Now our love memories present no exception to the general rules of memory, which in turn are governed by the still more general rules of Habit. And as Habit weakens every impression, what a person recalls to us most vividly is precisely what we had forgotten, because it was of no importance, and had therefore left in full possession of its strength. That is why the better part of our memory exists outside ourselves, in a blatter of rain, in the smell of an unaired room or of the first crackling brushwood fire in a cold grate: wherever, in short, we happen upon what our mind, having no use for it, had rejected, the last treasure that the past has in store, the richest, that which when all our flow of tears seems to have dried at the source can make us weep again. Outside ourselves, did I say; rather within ourselves, but hidden from our eyes in an oblivion more or less prolonged. It is thanks to this oblivion alone that we can from time to time recover the creature that we were, range ourselves face to face with past events as that creature had to face them, suffer afresh because we are no longer ourselves but he, and because he loved what leaves us now indifferent. In the broad daylight of our ordinary memory the images of the past turn gradually pale and fade out of sight, nothing remains of them, we shall never find them again. Or rather we should never find them again had not a few words (such as this ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Posts’) been carefully locked away in oblivion, just as an author deposits in the National Library a copy of a book which might otherwise become unobtainable /    But this suffering and this recrudescence of my love for Gilberte lasted no longer than such things last in a dream, and this time, on the contrary, because at Balbec the old Habit was no longer there to keep them alive. And if these two effects of Habit appear to be incompatible, that is because Habit is bound by a diversity of laws. In Paris I had grown more and more indifferent to Gilberte, thanks to Habit. The change of habit, that is to say the temporary cessation of Habit, completed Habit’s task when I started for Balbec. It weakens, but it stabilises; it leads to disintegration but it makes the scattered elements last indefinitely. Day after day, for years past, I had begun by modelling my state of mind, more or less effectively, upon that of the day before. At Balbec, a strange bed, to the side of which a tray was brought in the morning that differed from my Paris breakfast tray, could not, obviously, sustain the fancies upon which my love for Gilberte had fed: there are cases (though not, I admit, commonly) in which, one’s days being paralysed by a sedentary life, the best way to save time is to change one’s place of residence. My journey to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who needed only that to convince him that he was cured /    The journey was one that would now be made, probably, in a motorcar, which would be supposed to render it more interesting. We shall see too that, accomplished in such a way, it would even be in a sense more genuine, since one would be following more nearly, in a closer intimacy, the various contours by which the surface of the earth is wrinkled. But after all the special attraction of the journey lies not in our being able to alight at places on the way and to stop altogether as soon as we grow tired, but in its making the difference between departure and arrival not as imperceptible but as intense as possible, so that we are conscious of it in its totality, intact, as it existed in our mind when imagination bore us from the place in which we were living right to the very heart of a place we longed to see, in a single sweep which seemed miraculous to us not so much because it covered a certain distance as because it united two distinct individualities of the world, took us from one name to another name; and this difference is accentuated (more than in a form of locomotion in which, since one can stop and alight where one chooses, there can scarcely be said to be any point of arrival) by the mysterious operation that is performed in those peculiar places, railway stations, which do not constitute, so to speak, a part of the surrounding town but contain the essence of its personality just as upon their sign-boards they bear its painted name /    But in this respect as in every other, our age is infected with a mania for shewing things only in the environment that properly belongs to them, thereby suppressing the essential thing, the act of the mind which isolated them from that environment. A picture is nowadays ‘presented’ in the midst of furniture, ornaments, hangings of the same period, a secondhand scheme of decoration in the composition of which in the houses of to-day excels that same hostess who but yesterday was so crassly ignorant, but now spends her time poring over records and in libraries; and among these the masterpiece at which we glance up from the table while we dine does not give us that exhilarating delight which we can expect from it only in a public gallery, which symbolises far better by its bareness, by the absence of all irritating detail, those innermost spaces into which the artist withdrew to create it /    Unhappily those marvellous places which are railway stations, from which one sets out for a remote destination, are tragic places also, for if in them the miracle is accomplished whereby scenes which hitherto have had no existence save in our minds are to become the scenes among which we shall be living, for that very reason we must, as we emerge from the waiting-room, abandon any thought of finding ourself once again within the familiar walls which, but a moment ago, were still enclosing us. We must lay aside all hope of going home to sleep in our own bed, once we have made up our mind to penetrate into the pestiferous cavern through which we may have access to the mystery, into one of those vast, glass-roofed sheds, like that of Saint-Lazare into which I must go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent bowels of the city one of those bleak and boundless skies, heavy with an accumulation of dramatic menaces, like certain skies painted with an almost Parisian modernity by Mantegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished only some solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the Elevation of the Cross /    So long as I had been content to look out from the warmth of my own bed in Paris at the Persian church of Balbec, shrouded in driving sleet, no sort of objection to this journey had been offered by my body. Its objections began only when it had gathered that it would have itself to take part in the journey, and that on the evening of my arrival I should be shewn to ‘my’ room which to my body would be unknown. Its revolt was all the more deep-rooted in that on the very eve of my departure I learned that my mother would not be coming with us, my father, who would be kept busy at the Ministry until it was time for him to start for Spain with M. de Norpois, having preferred to take a house in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the other hand, the spectacle of Balbec seemed to me none the less desirable because I must purchase it at the price of a discomfort which, on the contrary, I felt to indicate and to guarantee the reality of the impression which I was going there to seek, an impression the place of which no spectacle of professedly equal value, no ‘panorama’ which I might have gone to see without being thereby precluded from returning home to sleep in my own bed, could possibly have filled. It was not for the first time that I felt that those who love and those who find pleasure are not always the same. I believed myself to be longing fully as much for Balbec as the doctor who was treating me, when he said to me, surprised, on the morning of our departure, to see me look so unhappy, “I don’t mind telling you that if I could only manage a week to go down and get a blow by the sea, I shouldn’t wait to be asked twice. You’ll be having races, regattas; you don’t know what all!” But I had already learned the lesson — long before I was taken to hear Berma — that, whatever it might be that I loved, it would never be attained save at the end of a long and heart-rending pursuit, in the course of which I should have first to sacrifice my own pleasure to that paramount good instead of seeking it there /    My grandmother, naturally enough, looked upon our exodus from a somewhat different point of view, and (for she was still as anxious as ever that the presents which were made me should take some artistic form) had planned, so that she might be offering me, of this journey, a ‘print’ that was, at least, in parts ‘old,’ that we should repeat, partly by rail and partly by road, the itinerary that Mme. de Sévigné followed when she went from Paris to ‘L’Orient’ by way of Chaulnes and ‘the Pont-Audemer.’ But my grandmother had been obliged to abandon this project, at the instance of my father who knew, whenever she organised any expedition with a view to extracting from it the utmost intellectual benefit that it was capable of yielding, what a tale there would be to tell of missed trains, lost luggage, sore throats and broken rules. She was free at least to rejoice in the thought that never, when the time came for us to sally forth to the beach, should we be exposed to the risk of being kept indoors by the sudden appearance of what her beloved Sévigné calls a ‘beast of a coachload,’ since we should know not a soul at Balbec, Legrandin having refrained from offering us a letter of introduction to his sister. (This abstention had not been so well appreciated by my aunts Céline and Flora, who, having known as a child that lady, of whom they had always spoken until then, to commemorate this early intimacy, as ‘Renée de Cambremer,’ and having had from her and still possessing a number of those little presents which continue to ornament a room or a conversation but to which the feeling between the parties no longer corresponds, imagined that they were avenging the insult offered to us by never uttering again, when they called upon Mme. Legrandin, the name of her daughter, confining themselves to a mutual congratulation, once they were safely out of the house: “I made no reference to you know whom!” “I think that went home!”) /    And so we were simply to leave Paris by that one twenty-two train which I had too often beguiled myself by looking out in the railway timetable, where its itinerary never failed to give me the emotion, almost the illusion of starting by it, not to feel that I already knew it. As the delineation in our mind of the features of any form of happiness depends more on the nature of the longings that it inspires in us than on the accuracy of the information which we have about it, I felt that I knew this train in all its details, nor did I doubt that I should feel, sitting in one of its compartments, a special delight as the day began to cool, should be contemplating this or that view as the train approached one or another station; so much so that this train, which always brought to my mind’s eye the images of the same towns, which I bathed in the sunlight of those post-meridian hours through which it sped, seemed to me to be different from every other train; and I had ended — as we are apt to do with a person whom we have never seen but of whom we like to believe that we have won his friendship — by giving a distinct and unalterable cast of countenance to the traveller, artistic, golden-haired, who would thus have taken me with him upon his journey, and to whom I should bid farewell beneath the Cathedral of Saint-Lo, before he hastened to overtake the setting sun /    As my grandmother could not bring herself to do anything so ‘stupid’ as to go straight to Balbec, she was to break the journey half-way, staying the night with one of her friends, from whose house I was to proceed the same evening, so as not to be in the way there and also in order that I might arrive by daylight and see Balbec Church, which, we had learned, was at some distance from Balbec-Plage, so that I might not have a chance to visit it later on, when I had begun my course of baths. And perhaps it was less painful for me to feel that the desirable goal of my journey stood between me and that cruel first night on which I should have to enter a new habitation, and consent to dwell there. But I had had first to leave the old; my mother had arranged to ‘move in,’ that afternoon, at Saint-Cloud, and had made, or pretended to make, all the arrangements for going there directly after she had seen us off at the station, without needing to call again at our own house to which she was afraid that I might otherwise feel impelled at the last moment, instead of going to Balbec, to return with her. In fact, on the pretext of having so much to see to in the house which she had just taken and of being pressed for time, but in reality so as to spare me the cruel ordeal of a long-drawn parting, she had decided not to wait with us until that moment of the signal to start at which, concealed hitherto among ineffective comings and goings and preparations that lead to nothing definite, separation is made suddenly manifest, impossible to endure when it is no longer possibly to be avoided, concentrated in its entirety in one enormous instant of impotent and supreme lucidity /    For the first time I began to feel that it was possible that my mother might live without me, otherwise than for me, a separate life. She was going to stay with my father, whose existence it may have seemed to her that my feeble health, my nervous excitability complicated somewhat and saddened. This separation made me all the more wretched because I told myself that it probably marked for my mother an end of the successive disappointments which I had caused her, of which she had never said a word to me but which had made her realise the difficulty of our taking our holidays together; and perhaps also the first trial of a form of existence to which she was beginning, now, to resign herself for the future, as the years crept on for my father and herself, an existence in which I should see less of her, in which (a thing that not even in my nightmares had yet been revealed to me) she would already have become something of a stranger, a lady who might be seen going home by herself to a house in which I should not be, asking the porter whether there was not a letter for her from me /    I could scarcely answer the man in the station who offered to take my bag. My mother, to comfort me, tried the methods which seemed to her most efficacious. Thinking it to be useless to appear not to notice my unhappiness, she gently teased me about it:    “Well, and what would Balbec church say if it knew that people pulled long faces like that when they were going to see it? Surely this is not the enraptured tourist Ruskin speaks of. Besides, I shall know if you rise to the occasion, even when we are miles apart I shall still be with my little man. You shall have a letter to-morrow from Mamma.” /     “My dear,” said my grandmother, “I picture you like Mme. de Sévigné, your eyes glued to the map, and never losing sight of us for an instant.” /    Then Mamma sought to distract my mind, asked me what I thought of having for dinner, drew my attention to Françoise, complimented her on a hat and cloak which she did not recognise, in spite of their having horrified her long ago when she first saw them, new, upon my great-aunt, one with an immense bird towering over it, the other decorated with a hideous pattern and jet beads. But the cloak having grown too shabby to wear, Françoise had had it turned, exposing an ‘inside’ of plain cloth and quite a good colour. As for the bird, it had long since come to grief and been thrown away. And just as it is disturbing, sometimes, to find the effects which the most conscious artists attain only by an effort occurring in a folk-song, on the wall of some peasant’s cottage where above the door, at the precisely right spot in the composition, blooms a white or yellow rose — so the velvet band, the loop of ribbon which would have delighted one in a portrait by Chardin or Whistler, Françoise had set with a simple but unerring taste upon the hat, which was now charming /    To take a parallel from an earlier age, the modesty and integrity which often gave an air of nobility to the face of our old servant having spread also to the garments which, as a woman reserved but not humbled, who knew how to hold her own and to keep her place, she had put on for the journey so as to be fit to be seen in our company without at the same time seeming or wishing to make herself conspicuous — Françoise in the cherry-coloured cloth, now faded, of her cloak, and the discreet nap of her fur collar, brought to mind one of those miniatures of Anne of Brittany painted in Books of Hours by an old master, in which everything is so exactly in the right place, the sense of the whole is so evenly distributed throughout the parts that the rich and obsolete singularity of the costume expresses the same pious gravity as the eyes, lips and hands /    Of thought, in relation to Françoise, one could hardly speak. She knew nothing, in that absolute sense in which to know nothing means to understand nothing, save the rare truths to which the heart is capable of directly attaining. The vast world of ideas existed not for her. But when one studied the clearness of her gaze, the lines of nose and lips, all those signs lacking from so many people of culture in whom they would else have signified a supreme distinction, the noble detachment of a chosen spirit, one was disquieted, as one is by the frank, intelligent eyes of a dog, to which, nevertheless, one knows that all our human concepts must be alien, and was led to ask oneself whether there might not be, among those other humble brethren, our peasant countrymen, creatures who were, like the great ones of the earth, of simple mind, or rather, doomed by a harsh fate to live among the simple-minded, deprived of heavenly light, were yet more naturally, more instinctively akin to the chosen spirits than most educated people, were, so to speak, all members, though scattered, straying, robbed of their heritage of reason, of the celestial family, kinsfolk, that have been lost in infancy, of the loftiest minds to whom — as is apparent from the unmistakable light in their eyes, although they can concentrate that light on nothing — there has been lacking, to endow them with talent, knowledge only /    My mother, seeing that I had difficulty in keeping back my tears, said to me: “‘Regulus was in the habit, when things looked grave. . . . ’ Besides, it isn’t nice for Mamma! What does Mme. de Sévigné say? Your grandmother will tell you: ‘I shall be obliged to draw upon all the courage that you lack.’” And remembering that affection for another distracts one’s selfish griefs, she endeavoured to beguile me by telling me that she expected the removal to Saint-Cloud to go without a hitch, that she liked the cab, which she had kept waiting, that the driver seemed civil and the seats comfortable. I made an effort to smile at these trifles, and bowed my head with an air of acquiescence and satisfaction. But they helped me only to depict to myself with more accuracy Mamma’s imminent departure, and it was with an agonised heart that I gazed at her as though she were already torn from me, beneath that wide-brimmed straw hat which she had bought to wear in the country, in a flimsy dress which she had put on in view of the long drive through the sweltering midday heat; hat and dress making her some one else, some one who belonged already to the Villa Montretout, in which I should not see her /    To prevent the choking fits which the journey might otherwise give me the doctor had advised me to take, as we started, a good stiff dose of beer or brandy, so as to begin the journey in a state of what he called ‘euphoria,’ in which the nervous system is for a time less vulnerable. I had not yet made up my mind whether I should do this, but I wished at least that my grandmother should admit that, if I did so decide, I should have wisdom and authority on my side. I spoke therefore as if my hesitation were concerned only with where I should go for my drink, to the bar on the platform or to the restaurant-car on the train. But immediately, at the air of reproach which my grandmother’s face assumed, an air of not wishing even to entertain such an idea for a moment, “What!” I said to myself, suddenly determining upon this action of going out to drink, the performance of which became necessary as a proof of my independence since the verbal announcement of it had not succeeded in passing unchallenged, “What! You know how ill I am, you know what the doctor ordered, and you treat me like this!” /    When I had explained to my grandmother how unwell I felt, her distress, her kindness were so apparent as she replied, “Run along then, quickly; get yourself some beer or a liqueur if it will do you any good,” that I flung myself upon her, almost smothering her in kisses. And if after that I went and drank a great deal too much in the restaurant-car of the train, that was because I felt that otherwise I should have a more violent attack than usual, which was just what would vex her most. When at the first stop I clambered back into our compartment I told my grandmother how pleased I was to be going to Balbec, that I felt that everything would go off splendidly, that after all I should soon grow used to being without Mamma, that the train was most comfortable, the steward and attendants in the bar so friendly that I should like to make the journey often so as to have opportunities of seeing them again. My grandmother, however, did not appear to feel the same joy as myself at all these good tidings. She answered, without looking me in the face: /     “Why don’t you try to get a little sleep?” and turned her gaze to the window, the blind of which, though we had drawn it, did not completely cover the glass, so that the sun could and did slip in over the polished oak of the door and the cloth of the seat (like an advertisement of a life shared with nature far more persuasive than those posted higher upon the walls of the compartment, by the railway company, representing places in the country the names of which I could not make out from where I sat) the same warm and slumberous light which lies along a forest glade /    But when my grandmother thought that my eyes were shut I could see her, now and again, from among the large black spots on her veil, steal a glance at me, then withdraw it, and steal back again, like a person trying to make himself, so as to get into the habit, perform some exercise that hurts him /    Thereupon I spoke to her, but that seemed not to please her either. And yet to myself the sound of my own voice was pleasant, as were the most imperceptible, the most internal movements of my body. And so I endeavoured to prolong it. I allowed each of my inflexions to hang lazily upon its word, I felt each glance from my eyes arrive just at the spot to which it was directed and stay there beyond the normal period. “Now, now, sit still and rest,” said my grandmother. “If you can’t manage to sleep, read something.” And she handed me a volume of Madame de Sévigné which I opened, while she buried herself in the  / Mémoires de Madame de Beausergent / . She never travelled anywhere without a volume of each. They were her two favourite authors. With no conscious movement of my head, feeling a keen pleasure in maintaining a posture after I had adopted it, I lay back holding in my hands the volume of Madame de Sévigné which I had allowed to close, without lowering my eyes to it, or indeed letting them see anything but the blue window-blind. But the contemplation of this blind appeared to me an admirable thing, and I should not have troubled to answer anyone who might have sought to distract me from contemplating it. The blue colour of this blind seemed to me, not perhaps by its beauty but by its intense vivacity, to efface so completely all the colours that had passed before my eyes from the day of my birth up to the moment in which I had gulped down the last of my drink and it had begun to take effect, that when compared with this blue they were as drab, as void as must be retrospectively the darkness in which he has lived to a man born blind whom a subsequent operation has at length enabled to see and to distinguish colours. An old ticket-collector came to ask for our tickets. The silvery gleam that shone from the metal buttons of his jacket charmed me in spite of my absorption. I wanted to ask him to sit down beside us. But he passed on to the next carriage, and I thought with longing of the life led by railwaymen for whom, since they spent all their time on the line, hardly a day could pass without their seeing this’ old collector. The pleasure that I found in staring at the blind, and in feeling that my mouth was half-open, began at length to diminish. I became more mobile; I even moved in my seat; I opened the book that my grandmother had given me and turned its pages casually, reading whatever caught my eye. And as I read I felt my admiration for Madame de Sévigné grow /    It is a mistake to let oneself be taken in by the purely formal details, idioms of the period or social conventions, the effect of which is that certain people believe that they have caught the Sévigné manner when they have said: “Tell me, my dear,” or “That Count struck me as being a man of parts,” or “Haymaking is the sweetest thing in the world.” Mme. de Simiane imagines already that she is being like her grandmother because she can write: “M. de la Boulie is bearing wonderfully, Sir, and is in excellent condition to hear the news of his death,” or “Oh, my dear Marquis, how your letter enchanted me! What can I do but answer it?” or “Meseems, Sir, that you owe me a letter, and I owe you some boxes of bergamot. I discharge my debt to the number of eight; others shall follow. . . . Never has the soil borne so many. Apparently for your gratification.” And she writes in this style also her letter on bleeding, on lemons and so forth, supposing it to be typical of the letters of Madame de Sévigné. But my grandmother who had approached that lady from within, attracted to her by her own love of kinsfolk and of nature, had taught me to enjoy the real beauties of her correspondence, which are altogether different. They were presently to strike me all the more forcibly inasmuch as Madame de Sévigné is a great artist of the same school as a painter whom I was to meet at Balbec, where his influence on my way of seeing things was immense. I realised at Balbec that it was in the same way as he that she presented things to her readers, in the order of our perception of them, instead of first having to explain them in relation to their several causes. But already that afternoon in the railway carriage, as I read over again that letter in which the moonlight comes: “I cannot resist the temptation: I put on all my bonnets and veils, though there is no need of them, I walk along this mall, where the air is as sweet as in my chamber; I find a thousand phantasms, monks white and black, sisters grey and white, linen cast here and there on the ground, men enshrouded upright against the tree-trunks,” I was enraptured by what, a little later, I should have described (for does not she draw landscapes in the same way as he draws characters?) as the Dostoievsky side of Madame de Sévigné‘s Letters /    When, that evening, after having accompanied my grandmother to her destination and spent some hours in her friend’s house, I had returned by myself to the train, at any rate I found nothing to distress me in the night which followed; this was because I had not to spend it in a room the somnolence of which would have kept me awake; I was surrounded by the soothing activity of all those movements of the train which kept me company, offered to stay and converse with me if I could not sleep, lulled me with their sounds which I wedded — as I had often wedded the chime of the Combray bells — now to one rhythm, now to another (hearing as the whim took me first four level and equivalent semi-quavers, then one semi-quaver furiously dashing against a crotchet); they neutralised the centrifugal force of my insomnia by exercising upon it a contrary pressure which kept me in equilibrium and on which my immobility and presently my drowsiness felt themselves to be borne with the same sense of refreshment that I should have had, had I been resting under the protecting vigilance of powerful forces, on the breast of nature and of life, had I been able for a moment to incarnate myself in a fish that sleeps in the sea, driven unheeding by the currents and the tides, or in an eagle outstretched upon the air, with no support but the storm   Sunrise is a necessary concomitant of long railway journeys, just as are hard-boiled eggs, illustrated papers, packs of cards, rivers upon which boats strain but make no progress. At a certain moment — when I was counting over the thoughts that had filled my mind, in the preceding minutes, so as to discover whether I had just been asleep or not (and when the very uncertainty which made me ask myself the question was to furnish me with an affirmative answer), in the pale square of the window, over a small black wood I saw some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink, not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the wing which has grown to wear it, or the sketch upon which the artist’s fancy has washed it. But I felt that, unlike them, this colour was due neither to inertia nor to caprice but to necessity and life. Presently there gathered behind it reserves of light. It brightened; the sky turned to a crimson which I strove, gluing my eyes to the window, to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but, the course of the line altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of the window to a nocturnal village, its roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent nacre of night, beneath a firmament still powdered with all its stars, and I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it afresh, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second bend in the line, so that I spent my time running from one window to the other to reassemble, to collect oh a single canvas the intermittent, antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever-changing morning, and to obtain a comprehensive view of it and a continuous picture /    The scenery became broken, abrupt, the train stopped at a little station between two mountains. Far down the gorge, on the edge of a hurrying Stream, one could see only a solitary watch-house, deep-planted in the water which ran past on a level with its windows. If a person can be the product of a soil the peculiar charm of which one distinguishes in that person, more even than the peasant girl whom I had so desperately longed to see appear when I wandered by myself along the Méséglise way, in the woods of Roussainville, such a person must be the big girl whom I now saw emerge from the house and, climbing a path lighted by the first slanting rays of the sun, come towards the station carrying a jar of milk. In her valley from which its congregated summits hid the rest of the world, she could never see anyone save in these trains which stopped for a moment only. She passed down the line of windows, offering coffee and milk to a few awakened passengers. Purpled with the glow of morning, her face was rosier than the sky. I felt in her presence that desire to live which is reborn in us whenever we become conscious anew of beauty and of happiness. We invariably forget that these are individual qualities, and, substituting for them in our mind a conventional type at which we arrive by striking a sort of mean amongst the different faces that have taken our fancy, the pleasures we have known, we are left with mere abstract images which are lifeless and dull because they are lacking in precisely that element of novelty, different from anything we have known, that element which is proper to beauty and to happiness. And we deliver on life a pessimistic judgment which we suppose to be fair, for we believed that we were taking into account when we formed it happiness and beauty, whereas in fact we left them out and replaced them by syntheses in which there is not a single atom of either. So it is that a well-read man will at once begin to yawn with boredom when anyone speaks to him of a new ‘good book,’ because he imagines a sort of composite of all the good books that he has read and knows already, whereas a good book is something special, something incalculable, and is made up not of the sum of all previous masterpieces but of something which the most thorough assimilation of every one of them would not enable him to discover, since it exists not in their sum but beyond it. Once he has become acquainted with this new work, the well-read man, till then apathetic, feels his interest awaken in the reality which it depicts. So, alien to the models of beauty which my fancy was won't to sketch when I was by myself, this strapping girl gave me at once the sensation of a certain happiness (the sole form, always different, in which we may learn the sensation of happiness), of a happiness that would be realised by my staying and living there by her side. But in this again the temporary cessation of Habit played a great part. I was giving the milk-girl the benefit of what was really my own entire being, ready to taste the keenest joys, which now confronted her. As a rule it is with our being reduced to a minimum that we live, most of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services. But on this morning of travel, the interruption of the routine of my existence, the change of place and time, had made their presence indispensable. My habits, which were sedentary and not matutinal, played me false, and all my faculties came hurrying to take their place, vying with one another in their zeal, rising, each of them, like waves in a storm, to the same unaccustomed level, from the basest to the most exalted, from breath, appetite, the circulation of my blood to receptivity and imagination. I cannot say whether, so as to make me believe that this girl was unlike the rest of women, the rugged charm of these barren tracts had been added to her own, but if so she gave it back to them. Life would have seemed an exquisite thing to me if only I had been free to spend it, hour after hour, with her, to go with her to the stream, to the cow, to the train, to be always at her side, to feel that I was known to her, had my place in her thoughts. She would have initiated me into the delights of country life and of the first hours of the day. I signalled to her to give me some of her coffee. I felt that I must be noticed by her. She did not see me; I called to her. Above her body, which was of massive build, the complexion of her face was so burnished and so ruddy that she appeared almost as though I were looking at her through a lighted window. She had turned and was coming towards me; I could not take my eyes from her face which grew larger as she approached, like a sun which it was somehow possible to arrest in its course and draw towards one, letting itself be seen at close quarters, blinding the eyes with its blaze of red and gold. She fastened on me her penetrating stare, but while the porters ran along the platform shutting doors the train had begun to move. I saw her leave the station and go down the hill to her home; it was broad daylight now; I was speeding away from the dawn. Whether my exaltation had been produced by this girl or had on the other hand been responsible for most of the pleasure that I had found in the sight of her, in the sense of her presence, in either event she was so closely associated with it that my desire to see her again was really not so much a physical as a mental desire, not to allow this state of enthusiasm to perish utterly, not to be separated for ever from the person who, although quite unconsciously, had participated in it. It was not only because this state was a pleasant one. It was principally because (just as increased tension upon a cord or accelerated vibration of a nerve produces a different sound or colour) it gave another tonality to all that I saw, introduced me as an actor upon the stage of an unknown and infinitely more interesting universe; that handsome girl whom I still could see, while the train gathered speed, was like part of a life other than the life that I knew, separated from it by a clear boundary, in which the sensations that things produced in me were no longer the same, from which to return now to my old life would be almost suicide. To procure myself the pleasure of feeling that I had at least an attachment to this new life, it would suffice that I should live near enough to the little station to be able to come to it every morning for a cup of coffee from the girl. But alas, she must be for ever absent from the other life towards which I was being borne with ever increasing swiftness, a life to the prospect of which I resigned myself only by weaving plans that would enable me to take the same train again some day and to stop at the same station, a project which would have the further advantage of providing with subject matter the selfish, active, practical, mechanical, indolent, centrifugal tendency which is that of the human mind; for our mind turns readily aside from the effort which is required if it is to analyse in itself, in a general and disinterested manner, a pleasant impression which we have received. And as, on the other hand, we wish to continue to think of that impression, the mind prefers to imagine it in the future tense, which while it gives us no clue as to the real nature of the thing, saves us the trouble of recreating it in our own consciousness and allows us to hope that we may receive it afresh from without /    Certain names of towns, Vezelay or Chartres, Bourses or Beauvais, serve to indicate, by abbreviation, the principal church in those towns. This partial acceptation, in which we are so accustomed to take the word, comes at length — if the names in question are those of places that we do not yet know — to fashion for us a mould of the name as a solid whole, which from that time onwards, whenever we wish it to convey the idea of the town — of that town which we have never seen — will impose on it, as on a cast, the same carved outlines, in the same style of art, will make of the town a sort of vast cathedral. It was, nevertheless, in a railway-station, above the door of a refreshment-room, that I read the name — almost Persian in style — of Balbec. I strode buoyantly through the station and across the avenue that led past it, I asked my way to the beach so as to see nothing in the place but its church and the sea; people seemed not to understand what I meant. Old Balbec, Balbec-en-Terre, at which I had arrived, had neither beach nor harbour. It was, most certainly, in the sea that the fishermen had found, according to the legend, the miraculous Christ, of which a window in the church that stood a few yards from where I now was recorded the discovery; it was indeed from cliffs battered by the waves that had been quarried the stone of its navfc and towers. But this sea, which for those reasons I had imagined as flowing up to die at the foot of the window, was twelve miles away and more, at Balbec-Plage, and, rising beside its cupola, that steeple, which, because I had read that it was itself a rugged Norman cliff on which seeds were blown and sprouted, round which the sea-birds wheeled, I had always pictured to myself as receiving at its base the last drying foam of the uplifted waves, stood on a Square from which two lines of tramway diverged, opposite a Café which bore, written in letters of gold, the word ‘Billiards’; it stood out against a background of houses with the roofs of which no upstanding mast was blended. And the church — entering my mind with the Café, with the passing stranger of whom I had had to ask my way, with the station to which presently I should have to return — made part of the general whole, seemed an accident, a by-product of this summer afternoon, in which its mellow and distended dome against the sky was like a fruit of which the same light that bathed the chimneys of the houses was ripening the skin, pink, glowing, melting-soft. But I wished only to consider the eternal significance of the carvings when I recognised the Apostles, which I had seen in casts in the Trocadéro museum, and which on either side of the Virgin, before the deep bay of the porch, were awaiting me as though to do me reverence. With their benign, blunt, mild faces and bowed shoulders they seemed to be advancing upon me with an air of welcome, singing the Alleluia of a fine day. But it was evident that their expression was unchanging as that on a dead man’s face, and could be modified only by my turning about to look at them in different aspects. I said to myself: “Here I am: this is the Church of Balbec. This square, which looks as though it were conscious of its glory, is the only place in the world that possesses Balbec Church. All that I have seen so far have been photographs of this church — and of these famous Apostles, this Virgin of the Porch, mere casts only. Now it is the church itself, the statue itself; these are they; they, the unique things — this is something far greater.” /    It was something less, perhaps, also. As a young man on the day of an examination or of a duel feels the question that he has been asked, the shot that he has fired, to be a very little thing when he thinks of the reserves of knowledge and of valour that he possesses and would like to have displayed, so my mind, which had exalted the Virgin of the Porch far above the reproductions that I had had before my eyes, inaccessible by the vicissitudes which had power to threaten them, intact although they were destroyed, ideal, endowed with universal value, was astonished to see the statue which it had carved a thousand times, reduced now to its own apparent form in stone, occupying, on the radius of my outstretched arm, a place in which it had for rivals an election placard and the point of my stick, fettered to the Square, inseparable from the head of the main street, powerless to hide from the gaze of the Café and of the omnibus office, receiving on its face half of that ray of the setting sun (half, presently, in a few hours’ time, of the light of the street lamp) of which the Bank building received the other half, tainted simultaneously with that branch office of a money-lending establishment by the smells from the pastry-cook’s oven, subjected to the tyranny of the Individual to such a point that, if I had chosen to scribble my name upon that stone, it was she, the illustrious Virgin whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an intangible beauty, the Virgin of Balbec, the unique (which meant, alas, the only one) who, on her body coated with the same soot as defiled the neighbouring houses, would have displayed — powerless to rid herself of them — to all the admiring strangers come there to gaze upon her, the marks of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name; it was she, indeed, the immortal work of art, so long desired, whom I found, transformed, as was the church itself, into a little old woman in stone whose height I could measure and count her wrinkles. But time was passing; I must return to the station, where I was to wait for my grandmother and Françoise, so that we should all arrive at Balbec-Plage together. I reminded myself of what I had read about Balbec, of Swann’s saying: “It is exquisite; as fine as Siena.” And casting the blame for my disappointment upon various accidental causes, such as the state of my health, my exhaustion after the journey, my incapacity for looking at things properly, I endeavoured to console myself with the thought that other towns remained still intact for me, that I might soon, perhaps, be making my way, as into a shower of pearls, into the cool pattering sound that dripped from Quimperlé, cross that green water lit by a rosy glow in which Pont-Aven was bathed; but as for Balbec, no sooner had I set foot in it than it was as though I had broken open a name which ought to have been kept hermetically closed, and into which, seizing at once the opportunity that I had imprudently given them when I expelled all the images that had been living in it until then, a tramway, a Café, people crossing the square, the local branch of a Bank, irresistibly propelled by some external pressure, by a pneumatic force, had come crowding into the interior of those two syllables which, closing over them, let them now serve as a border to the porch of the Persian church, and would never henceforward cease to contain them /    In the little train of the local railway company which was to take us to Balbec-Plage I found my grandmother, but found her alone — for, imagining that she was sending Françoise on ahead of her, so as to have everything ready before we arrived, but having mixed up her instructions, she had succeeded only in packing off Françoise in the wrong direction, who at that moment was being carried down all unsuspectingly, at full speed, to Nantes, and would probably wake up next morning at Bordeaux. No sooner had I taken my seat in the carriage, filled with the fleeting light of sunset and with the lingering heat of the afternoon (the former enabling me, alas, to see written clearly upon my grandmother’s face how much the latter had tired her), than she began: “Well, and Balbec?” with a smile so brightly illuminated by her expectation of the great pleasure which she supposed me to have been enjoying that I dared not at once confess to her my disappointment. Besides, the impression which my mind had been seeking occupied it steadily less as the place drew nearer to which my body would have to become accustomed. At the end — still more than an hour away — of this journey I was trying to form a picture of the manager of the hotel at Balbec, to whom I, at that moment, did not exist, and I should have liked to be going to present myself to him in more impressive company than that of my grandmother, who would be certain to ask for a reduction of his terms. The only thing positive about him was his haughty condescension; his lineaments were still vague /    Every few minutes the little train brought us to a standstill in one of the stations which came before Balbec-Plage, stations the mere names of which (Incarville, Marcouville, Doville, Pont-a-Couleuvre, Arambouville, Saint-Mars-le-Vieux, Hermonville, Maineville) seemed to me outlandish, whereas if I had come upon them in a book I should at once have been struck by their affinity to the names of certain places in the neighbourhood of Combray. But to the trained ear two musical airs, consisting each of so many notes, several of which are common to them both, will present no similarity whatever if they differ in the colour of their harmony and orchestration. So it was that nothing could have reminded me less than these dreary names, made up of sand, of space too airy and empty and of salt, out of which the termination ‘ville’ always escaped, as the ‘fly’ seems to spring out from the end of the word ‘butterfly’— nothing could have reminded me less of those other names, Roussainville or Martinville, which, because I had heard them pronounced so often by my great-aunt at table, in the dining-room, had acquired a certain sombre charm in which were blended perhaps extracts of the flavour of ‘preserves,’ the smell of the fire of logs and of the pages of one of Bergotte’s books, the colour of the stony front of the house opposite, all of which things still to-day when they rise like a gaseous bubble from the depths of my memory preserve their own specific virtue through all the successive layers of rival interests which must be traversed before they reach the surface /    These were — commanding the distant sea from the crests of their several dunes or folding themselves already for the night beneath hills of a crude green colour and uncomfortable shape, like that of the sofa in one’s bedroom in an hotel at which one has just arrived, each composed of a cluster of villas whose line was extended to include a lawn-tennis court and now and then a casino, over which a flag would be snapping in the freshening breeze, like a hollow cough — a series of watering-places which now let me see for the first time their regular visitors, but let me see only the external features of those visitors — lawn-tennis players in white hats, the station-master spending all his life there on the spot among his tamarisks and roses, a lady in a straw ‘boater’ who, following the everyday routine of an existence which I should never know, was calling to her dog which had stopped to examine something in the road before going in to her bungalow where the lamp was already lighted for her return — which with these strangely usual and slightingly familiar sights stung my un-greeted eyes and stabbed my exiled heart. But how much were my sufferings increased when we had finally landed in the hall of the Grand Hotel at Balbec, and I stood there in front of the monumental staircase that looked like marble, while my grandmother, regardless of the growing hostility of the strangers among whom we should have to live, discussed ‘terms’ with the manager, a sort of nodding mandarin whose face and voice were alike covered with scars (left by the excision of countless pustules from one and from the other of the divers accents acquired from an alien ancestry and in a cosmopolitan upbringing) who stood there in a smart dinner-jacket, with the air of an expert psychologist, classifying, whenever the ‘omnibus’ discharged a fresh load, the ‘nobility and gentry’ as ‘geesers’ and the ‘hotel crooks’ as nobility and gentry. Forgetting, probably, that he himself was not drawing five hundred francs a month, he had a profound contempt for people to whom five hundred francs — or, as he preferred ta put it,‘twenty-five louis’ was ‘a lot of money,’ and regarded them as belonging to a race of pariahs for whom the Grand Hotel was certainly not intended. It is true that even within its walls there were people who did not pay very much and yet had not forfeited the manager’s esteem, provided that he was assured that they were watching their expenditure not from poverty so much as from avarice. For this could in no way lower their standing since it is a vice and may consequently be found at every grade of social position. Social position was the one thing by which the manager was impressed, social position, or rather the signs which seemed to him to imply that it was exalted, such as not taking one’s hat off when one came into the hall, wearing knickerbockers, or an overcoat with a waist, and taking a cigar with a band of purple and gold out of a crushed morocco case — to none of which advantages could I, alas, lay claim. He would also adorn his business conversation with choice expressions, to which, as a rule, he gave a wrong meaning /    While I heard my grandmother, who shewed no sign of annoyance at his listening to her with his hat on his head and whistling through his teeth at her, ask him in an artificial voice, “And what are . . . your charges? . . . Oh! far too high for my little budget,” waiting upon a bench, I sought refuge in the innermost depths of my own consciousness, strove to migrate to a plane of eternal thoughts — to leave nothing of myself, nothing that lived and felt on the surface of my body, anaesthetised as are those of animals which by inhibition feign death when they are attacked — so as not to suffer too keenly in this place, with which my total unfamiliarity was made all the more evident to me when I saw the familiarity that seemed at the same moment to be enjoyed by a smartly dressed lady for whom the manager shewed his respect by taking liberties with the little dog that followed her across the hall, the young ‘blood’ with a feather in his hat who asked, as he came in, ‘Any letters?’— all these people to whom it was an act of home-coming to mount those stairs of imitation marble. And at the same time the triple frown of Minos, ^Eacus and Rhadamanthus (beneath which I plunged my naked soul as into an unknown element where there was nothing now to protect it) was bent sternly upon me by a group of gentlemen who, though little versed perhaps in the art of receiving, yet bore the title ‘Reception Clerks,’ while beyond them again, through a closed wall of glass, were people sitting in a reading-room for the description of which I should have had to borrow from Dante alternately the colours in which he paints Paradise and Hell, according as I was thinking of the happiness of the elect who had the right to sit and read there undisturbed, or of the terror which my grandmother would have inspired in me if, in her insensibility to this sort of impression, she had asked me to go in there and wait for her by myself /    My sense of loneliness was further increased a moment later: when I had confessed to my grandmother that I did not feel well, that I thought that we should be obliged to return to Paris, she had offered no protest, saying merely that she was going out to buy a few things which would be equally useful whether we left or stayed (and which, I afterwards learned, were all for my benefit, Françoise having gone off with certain articles which I might need); while I waited for her I had taken a turn through the streets, packed with a crowd of people who imparted to them a sort of indoor warmth, streets in which were still open the hairdresser’s shop and the pastry-cook’s, the latter filled with customers eating ices, opposite the statue of Duguay-Trouin. This crowd gave me just about as much pleasure as a photograph of it in one of the ‘illustrateds’ might give a patient who was turning its pages in the surgeon’s waiting-room. I was astonished to find that there were people so different from myself that this stroll through the town had actually been recommended to me by the manager as a distraction, and also that the torture chamber which a new place of residence is could appear to some people a ‘continuous amusement,’ to quote the hotel prospectus, which might, it was true, exaggerate, but was, for all that, addressed to a whole army of clients to whose tastes it must appeal. True, it invoked, to make them come to the Grand Hotel, Balbec, not only the ‘exquisite fare’ and the ‘fairy-like view across the Casino gardens,’ but also the ‘ordinances of her Majesty Queen Fashion, which no one may break with impunity, or without being taken for a Boeotian, a charge that no well-bred man would willingly incur.’ The need that I now had of my grandmother was enhanced by my fear that I had shattered another of her illusions. She must be feeling discouraged, feeling that if I could not stand the fatigue of this journey there was no hope that any change of air could ever do me good. I decided to return to the hotel and to wait for her there: the manager himself came forward and pressed a button, and a person whose acquaintance I had not yet made, labelled ‘LIFT’ (who at that highest point in the building, which corresponded to the lantern in a Norman church, was installed like a photographer in his darkroom or an organist in his loft) came rushing down towards me with the agility of a squirrel, tamed, active, caged. Then, sliding upwards again along a steel pillar, he bore me aloft in his train towards the dome of this temple of Mammon. On each floor, on either side of a narrow communicating stair, opened out fanwise a range of shadowy galleries, along one of which, carrying a bolster, a chambermaid came past. I lent to her face, which the gathering dusk made featureless, the mask of my most impassioned dreams of beauty, but read in her eyes as they turned towards me the horror of my own nonentity. Meanwhile, to dissipate, in the course of this interminable assent, the mortal anguish which I felt in penetrating thus in silence the mystery of this chiaroscuro so devoid of poetry, lighted by a single vertical line of little windows which were those of the solitary water-closet on each landing, I addressed a few words to the young organist, artificer of my journey and my partner in captivity, who continued to manipulate the registers of his instrument and to finger the stops. I apologised for taking up so much room, for giving him so much trouble, and asked whether I was not obstructing him in the practice of an art to which, so as to flatter the performer, I did more than display curiosity, I confessed my strong attachment. But he vouchsafed no answer, whether from astonishment at my words, preoccupation with what he was doing, regard for convention, hardness of hearing, respect for holy ground, fear of danger, slowness of understanding, or by the manager’s orders /    There is perhaps nothing that gives us so strong an impression of the reality of the external world as the difference in the positions, relative to ourselves, of even a quite unimportant person before we have met him and after. I was the same man who had taken, that afternoon, the little train from Balbec to the coast, I carried in my body the same consciousness But on that consciousness, in the place where, at six o’clock, there had been, with the impossibility of forming any idea of the manager, the Grand Hotel or its occupants, a vague and timorous impatience for the moment at which I should reach my destination, were to be found now the pustules excised from the face of the cosmopolitan manager (he was, as a matter of fact, a naturalised Monégasque, although — as he himself put it, for he was always using expressions which he thought distinguished without noticing that they were incorrect —‘of Rumanian originality’), his action in ringing for the lift, the lift-boy himself, a whole frieze of puppet-show characters issuing from that Pandora’s box which was the Grand Hotel, undeniable, irremovable, and, like everything that is realised, sterilising. But at least this change, which I had done nothing to bring about, proved to me that something had happened which was external to myself — however devoid of interest that thing might be — and I was like a traveller who, having had the sun in his face when he started, concludes that he has been for so many hours on the road when he finds the sun behind him. I was half dead with exhaustion, I was burning with fever; I would gladly have gone to bed, but I had no night-things. I should have liked at least to lie down for a little while on the bed, but what good would that have done me, seeing that I should not have been able to find any rest there for that mass of sensations which is for each of us his sentient if not his material body, and that the unfamiliar objects which encircled that body, forcing it to set its perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant and defensive guard, would have kept my sight, my hearing, all my senses in a position as cramped and comfortless (even if I had stretched out my legs) as that of Cardinal La Balue in the cage in which he could neither stand nor sit. It is our noticing them that puts things in a room, our growing used to them that takes them away again and clears a space for us. Space there was none for me in my bedroom (mine in name only) at Balbec; it was full of things which did not know me, which flung back at me the distrustful look that I had cast at them, and, without taking any heed of my existence, shewed that I was interrupting the course of theirs. The clock — whereas at home I heard my clock tick only a few seconds in a week, when I was coming out of some profound meditation — continued without a moment’s interruption to utter, in an unknown tongue, a series of observations which must have been most uncomplimentary to myself, for the violet curtains listened to them without replying, but in an attitude such as people adopt who shrug their shoulders to indicate that the sight of a third person irritates them. They gave to this room with its lofty ceiling a semi-historical character which might have made it a suitable place for the assassination of the Duc de Guise, and afterwards for parties of tourists personally conducted by one of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son’s guides, but for me to sleep in — no. I was tormented by the presence of some little bookcases with glass fronts which ran along the walls, but especially by a large mirror with feet which stood across one corner, for I felt that until it had left the room there would be no possibility of rest for me there. I kept raising my eyes — which the things in my room in Paris disturbed no more than did my eyelids themselves, for they were merely extensions of my organs, an enlargement of myself — towards the fantastically high ceiling of this belvedere planted upon the summit of the hotel which my grandmother had chosen for me; and in that region more intimate than those in which we see and hear, that region in which we test the quality of odours, almost in the very heart of my inmost self, the smell of flowering grasses next launched its offensive against my last feeble line of trenches, where I stood up to it, not without tiring myself still further, with the futile incessant defence of an anxious sniffing. Having no world, no room, no body now that was not menaced by the enemies thronging round me, invaded to the very bones by fever, I was utterly alone; I longed to die. Then my grandmother came in, and to the expansion of my ebbing heart there opened at once an infinity of space /    She was wearing a loose cambric gown which she put on at home whenever any of us was ill (because she felt more comfortable in it, she used to say, for she always ascribed to her actions a selfish motive), and which was, for tending us, for watching by our beds, her servant’s livery, her nurse’s uniform, her religious habit. But whereas the trouble that servants, nurses, religious take, their kindness to us, the merits that we discover in them and the gratitude that we owe them all go to increase the impression that we have of being, in their eyes, some one different, of feeling that we are alone, keeping in our own hands the control over our thoughts, our will to live, I knew, when I was with my grandmother, that, however great the misery that there was in me, it would be received by her with a pity still more vast; that everything that was mine, my cares, my wishes, would be, in my grandmother, supported upon a desire to save and prolong my life stronger than was my own; and my thoughts were continued in her without having to undergo any deflection, since they passed from my mind into hers without change of atmosphere or of personality. And — like a man who tries to fasten his necktie in front of a glass and forgets that the end which he sees reflected is not on the side to which he raises his hand, or like a dog that chases along the ground the dancing shadow of an insect in the air — misled by her appearance in the body as we are apt to be in this world where we have no direct perception of people’s souls, I threw myself into the arms of my grandmother and clung with my lips to her face as though I had access thus to that immense heart which she opened to me. And when I felt my mouth glued to her cheeks, to her brow, I drew from them something so beneficial, so nourishing that I lay in her arms as motionless, as solemn, as calmly gluttonous as a babe at the breast /    At last I let go, and lay and gazed, and could not tire of gazing at her large face, as clear in its outline as a fine cloud, glowing and serene, behind which I could discern the radiance of her tender love. And everything that received, in however slight a degree, any share of her sensations, everything that could be said to belong in any way to her was at once so spiritualised, so sanctified, that with outstretched hands I smoothed her dear hair, still hardly grey, with as much respect, precaution, comfort as if I had actually been touching her goodness. She found a similar pleasure in taking any trouble that saved me one, and in a moment of immobility and rest for my weary limbs something so delicious that when, having seen that she wished to help me with my undressing and to take my boots off, I made as though to stop her and began to undress myself, with an imploring gaze she arrested my hands as they fumbled with the top buttons of my coat and boots /     “Oh, do let me!” she begged. “It is such a joy for your Granny. And be sure you knock on the wall if you want anything in the night. My bed is just on the other side, and the partition is, quite thin. Just give a knock now, as soon as you are ready, so that we shall know where we are.”   And, sure enough, that evening I gave three knocks — a signal which, the week after, when I was ill, I repeated every morning for several days, because my grandmother wanted me to have some milk early. Then, when I thought that I could hear her stirring, so that she should not be kept waiting but might, the moment she had brought me the milk, go to sleep again, I ventured on three little taps, timidly, faintly, but for all that distinctly, for if I was afraid of disturbing her, supposing that I had been mistaken and that she was still asleep, I should not have wished her either to lie awake listening for a summons which she had not at once caught and which I should not have the courage to repeat. And scarcely had I given my taps than I heard three others, in a different intonation from mine, stamped with a calm authority, repeated twice over so that there should be no mistake, and saying to me plainly: “Don’t get excited; I heard you; I shall be with you in a minute!” and shortly afterwards my grandmother appeared. I explained to her that I had been afraid that she would not hear me, or might think that it was some one in the room beyond who was lapping; at which she smiled: /     “Mistake my poor chick’s knocking for anyone else! Why, Granny could tell it among a thousand! Do you suppose there’s anyone else in the world who’s such a silly-billy, with such feverish little knuckles, so afraid of waking me up and of not making me understand? Even if he just gave the least scratch, Granny could tell her mouse’s sound at once, especially such a poor miserable little mouse as mine is. I could hear it just now, trying to make up its mind, and rustling the bedclothes, and going through all its tricks.” /    She pushed open the shutters; where a wing of the hotel jutted out at right angles to my window, the sun was already installed upon the roof, like a slater who is up betimes, and starts early and works quietly so as not to rouse the sleeping town, whose stillness seems to enhance his activity. She told me what o’clock, what sort of day it was; that it was not worth while my getting up and coming to the window, that there was a mist over the sea; if the baker’s shop had opened yet; what the vehicle was that I could hear passing. All that brief, trivial curtain-raiser, that negligible introit of a new day, performed without any spectator, a little scrap of life which was only for our two selves, which I should have no hesitation in repeating, later on, to Françoise or even to strangers, speaking of the fog ‘which you could have cut with a knife at six o’clock that morning, with the ostentation of one who was boasting not of a piece of knowledge that he had acquired but of a mark of affection shewn to himself alone; dear morning moment, opened like a symphony by the rhythmical dialogue of my three taps, to which the thin wall of my bedroom, steeped in love and joy, grown melodious, immaterial, singing like the angelic choir, responded with three other taps, eagerly awaited, repeated once and again, in which it contrived to waft to me the soul of my grandmother, whole and perfect, and the promise of her coming, with a swiftness of annunciation and melodic accuracy. But on this first night after our arrival, when my grandmqther had left me, I began again to feel as I had felt, the day before, in Paris, at the moment of leaving home. Perhaps this fear that I had — and shared with so many of my fellow-men — of sleeping in a strange room, perhaps this fear is only the most humble, obscure, organic, almost unconscious form of that great and desperate resistance set up by the things that constitute the better part of our present life towards our mentally assuming, by accepting it as true, the formula of a future in which those things are to have no part; a resistance which was at the root of the horror that I had so often been made to feel by the thought that my parents must, one day, die, that the stern necessity of life might qblige me to live remote from Gilberte, or simply to settle permanently in a place where I should never see any of my old friends; a resistance which was also at the root of the difficulty that I found in imagining my own death, or a survival such as Bergotte used to promise to mankind in his books, a survival in which I should not be allowed to take with me my memories, my frailties, my character, which did not easily resign themselves to the idea of ceasing to be, and desired for me neither annihilation nor an eternity in which they would have no part /    When Swann had said to me, in Paris one day when I felt particularly unwell: “You ought to go off to one of those glorious islands in the Pacific; you’d never come back again if you did.” I should have liked to answer: “But then I shall not see your daughter any more; I shall be living among people and things she has never seen.” And yet my better judgment whispered: “What difference can that make, since you are not going to be affected by it? When M. Swann tells you that you will not come back he means by that that you will not want to come back, and if you don’t want to that is because you will be happier out there.” For my judgment was aware that Habit — Habit which was even now setting to work to make me like this unfamiliar lodging, to change the position of the mirror, the shade of the curtains, to stop the clock — undertakes as well to make dear to us the companions whom at first we disliked, to give another appearance to their faces, to make attractive the sound of their voices, to modify the inclinations of their hearts. It is true that these new friendships for places and people are based upon forgetfulness of the old; but what my better judgment was thinking was simply that I could look without apprehension along the vista of a life in which I should be for ever separated from people all memory of whom I should lose, and it was by way of consolation that my mind was offering to my heart a promise of oblivion which succeeded only in sharpening the edge of its despair. Not that the heart also is not bound in time, when separation is complete, to feel the anodyne effect of habit; but until then it will continue to suffer. And our dread of a future in which we must forego the sight of faces, the sound of voices that we love, friends from whom we derive to-day our keenest joys, this dread, far from being dissipated, is intensified, if to the grief of such a privation we reflect that there will be added what seems to us now in anticipation an even more cruel grief; not to feel it as a grief at all — to remain indifferent; for if that should occur, our ego would have changed, it would then be not merely the attractiveness of our family, pur mistress, our friends that had ceased to environ us, but our affection for them; it would have been so completely eradicated from our heart, in which to-day it is a conspicuous element, that we should be able to enjoy that life apart from them the very thought of which to-day makes us recoil in horror; so that it would be in a real sense the death of ourselves, a death followed, it is true, by resurrection but in a different ego, the life, the love of which are beyond the reach of those elements of the existing ego that are doomed to die. It is they — even the meanest of them, such as our obscure attachments to the dimensions, to the atmosphere of a bedroom — that grow stubborn and refuse, in acts of rebellion which we must recognise to be a secret, partial, tangible and true aspect of our resistance to death, of the long resistance, desperate and daily renewed, to a fragmentary and gradual death such as interpolates itself throughout the whole course of our life, tearing away from us at every moment a shred of ourselves, dead matter on which new cells will multiply, and grow. And for a neurotic nature such as mine, one that is to say in which the intermediaries, the nerves, perform their functions badly — fail to arrest on its way to the consciousness, allow indeed to penetrate there, distinct, exhausting, innumerable, agonising, the plaint of those most humble elements of the personality which are about to disappear — the anxiety and alarm which I felt as I lay outstretched beneath that strange and too lofty ceiling were but the protest of an affection that survived in me for a ceiling that was familiar and low. Doubtless this affection too would disappear, and another have taken its place (when death, and then another life, would, in the guise of Habit, have performed their double task); but until its annihilation, every night it would suffer afresh, and on this first night especially, confronted with a future already realised in which there would no longer be any place for it, it rose in revolt, it tortured me with the sharp sound of its lamentations whenever my straining eyes, powerless to turn from what was wounding them, endeavoured to fasten their gaze upon that inaccessible ceiling /    But next morning! — after a servant had come to call me, and had brought me hot water, and while I was washing and dressing myself and trying in vain to find the things that I wanted in my trunk, from which I extracted, pell-mell, only a lot of things that were of no use whatever, what a joy it was to me, thinking already of the delights of luncheon and of a walk along the shore, to see in the window, and in all the glass fronts of the bookcases as in the portholes of a ship’s cabin, the open sea, naked, unshadowed, and yet with half of its expanse in shadow, bounded by a thin and fluctuant line, and to follow with my eyes the waves that came leaping towards me, one behind another, like divers along a springboard. Every other moment, holding in one hand the starched, unyielding towel, with the name of the hotel printed upon it, with which I was making futile efforts to dry myself, I returned to the window to gaze once more upon that vast amphitheatre, dazzling, mountainous, and upon the snowy crests of its emerald waves, here and there polished and translucent, which with a placid violence, a leonine bending of the brows, let their steep fronts, to which the sun now added a smile without face or features, run forward to their goal, totter and melt and be no more. Window in which I was, henceforward, to plant myself every morning, as at the pane of a mail coach in which one has slept, to see whether, in the night, a long sought mountain-chain has come nearer or withdrawn — only here it was those hills of the sea which, before they come dancing back towards us, are apt to retire so far that often it was only at the end of a long and sandy plain that I would distinguish, miles it seemed away, their first undulations upon a background transparent, vaporous, bluish, like the glaciers that one sees in the backgrounds of the Tuscan Primitives. On other mornings it was quite close at hand that the sun was smiling upon those waters of a green as tender as that preserved in Alpine pastures (among mountains on which the sun spreads himself here and there like a lazy giant who may at any moment come leaping gaily down their craggy sides) less by the moisture of their soil than by the liquid mobility of their light. Anyhow, in that breach which shore and water between them drive through all the rest of the world, for the passage, the accumulation there of light, it is light above all, according to the direction from which it comes and along which our eyes follow it, it is light that shifts and fixes the undulations of the sea. Difference of lighting modifies no less the orientation of a place, constructs no less before our eyes new goals which it inspires in us the yearning to attain, than would a distance in space actually traversed in the course of a long journey. When, in the morning, the sun came from behind the hotel, disclosing to me the sands bathed in light as far as the first bastions of the sea, it seemed to be shewing me another side of the picture, and to be engaging me in the pursuit, along the winding path of its rays, of a journey motionless but ever varied amid all the fairest scenes of the diversified landscape of the hours. And on this first morning the sun pointed out to me far off with a jovial finger those blue peaks of the sea, which bear no name upon any geographer’s chart, until, dizzy with its sublime excursion over the thundering and chaotic surface of their crests and avalanches, it came back to take shelter from the wind in my bedroom, swaggering across the unmade bed and scattering its riches over the splashed surface of the basin-stand, and into my open trunk, where by its very splendour and ill-matched luxury it added still further to the general effect of disorder. Alas, that wind from the sea; an hour later, in the great dining-room — while we were having our luncheon, and from the leathern gourd of a lemon were sprinkling a few golden drops on to a pair of soles which presently left on our plates the plumes of their picked skeletons, curled like stiff feathers and resonant as citherns — it seemed to my grandmother a cruel deprivation not to be able to feel its life-giving breath on her cheek, on account of the window, transparent but closed, which like the front of a glass case in a museum divided us from the beach while allowing us to look out upon its whole extent, and into which the sky entered so completely that its azure had the effect of being the colour of the windows and its white clouds only so many flaws in the glass. Imagining that I was ‘seated upon the mole’ or at rest in the ‘boudoir’ of which Baudelaire speaks I asked myself whether his ‘Sun’s rays upon the sea’ were not — a very different thing from the evening ray, simple and superficial as the wavering stroke of a golden pencil — just what at that moment was scorching the sea topaz-brown, fermenting it, turning it pale and milky like foaming beer, like milk, while now and then there hovered over it great blue shadows which some god seemed, for his pastime, to be shifting to and fro by moving a mirror in the sky. Unfortunately, it was not only in its outlook that it differed from our room at Combray, giving upon the houses over the way, this dining-room at Balbec, bare-walled, filled with a sunlight green as the water in a marble font, while a few feet away the full tide and broad daylight erected as though before the gates of the heavenly city an indestructible and moving rampart of emerald and gold. At Combray, since we were known to everyone, I took heed of no one. In life at the seaside one knows only one’s own party. I was not yet old enough, I was still too sensitive to have outgrown the desire to find favour in the sight of other people and to possess their hearts. Nor had I acquired the more noble indifference which a man of the world would have felt, with regard to the people who were eating their luncheon in the room, nor to the boys and girls who strolled past the window, with whom I was pained by the thought that I should never be allowed to go on expeditions, though not so much pained as if my grandmother, contemptuous of social formalities and concerned about nothing but my health, had gone to them with the request, humiliating for me to overhear, that they would consent to let me accompany them. Whether they were returning to some villa beyond my ken, or had emerged from it, racquet in hand, on their way to some lawn-tennis court, or were mounted on horses whose hooves trampled and tore my heart, I gazed at them with a passionate curiosity, in that blinding light of the beach by which social distinctions are altered, I followed all their movements through the transparency of that great bay of glass which allowed so much light to flood the room. But it intercepted the wind, and this seemed wrong to my grandmother, who, unable to endure the thought that I was losing the benefit of an hour in the open air, surreptitiously unlatched a pane and at once set flying, with the bills of fare, the newspapers, veils and hats of all the people at the other tables; she herself, fortified by the breath of heaven, remained calm and smiling like Saint Blandina, amid the torrent of invective which, increasing my sense of isolation and misery, those scornful, dishevelled, furious visitors combined to pour on us /    To a certain extent — and this, at Balbec, gave to the population, as a rule monotonously rich and cosmopolitan, of that sort of smart and ‘exclusive’ hotel, a quite distinctive local character — they were composed of eminent persons from the departmental capitals of that region of France, a chief magistrate from Caen, a leader of the Cherbourg bar, a big solicitor from Le Mans, who annually, when the holidays came round, starting from the various points over which, throughout the working year, they were scattered like snipers in a battle or draughtsmen upon a board, concentrated their forces upon this hotel. They always reserved the same rooms, and with their wives, who had pretensions to aristocracy, formed a little group, which was joined by a leading barrister and a leading doctor from Paris, who on the day of their departure would say to the others: /     “Oh, yes, of course; you don’t go by our train. You are fortunate, you will be home in time for luncheon.” /     “Fortunate, do you say? You, who live in the Capital, in ‘Paris, the great town,’ while I have to live in a wretched county town of a hundred thousand souls (it is true, we managed to muster a hundred and two thousand at the last census, but what is that compared to your two and a half millions?) going back, too, to asphalt streets and all the bustle and gaiety of Paris life?” /    They said this with a rustic burring of their r’s, but without bitterness, for they were leading lights each in his own province, who could like other people have gone to Paris had they chosen — the chief magistrate of Caen had several times been offered a judgeship in the Court of Appeal — but had preferred to stay where they were, from love of their native towns or of obscurity or of fame, or because they were reactionaries, and enjoyed being on friendly terms with the country houses of the neighbourhood. Besides several of them were not going back at once to their county towns /    For — inasmuch as the Bay of Balbec was a little world apart in the midst of a great world, a basketful of the seasons in which were clustered in a ring good days and bad, and the months in their order, so that not only, on days when one could make out Rivebelle, which was in itself a sign of coming storms, could one see the sunlight on the houses there while Balbec was plunged in darkness, but later on, when the cold weather had reached Balbec, one could be certain of finding on that opposite shore two or three supplementary months of warmth — those of the regular visitors to the Grand Hotel whose holidays began late or lasted long, gave orders, when rain and fog came and Autumn was in the air, for their boxes to be packed and embarked, and set sail across the Bay to find summer again at Rivebelle or Costedor. This little group in the Balbec hotel looked with distrust upon each new arrival, and while affecting to take not the least interest in him, hastened, all of them, to ply with questions their friend the head waiter. For it was the same head waiter — Aimé— who returned every year for the season, and kept their tables for them; and their good ladies, having heard that his wife was ‘expecting,’ would sit after meals working each at one of the ‘little things,’ stopping only to put up their glasses and stare at us, my grandmother and myself, because we were eating hard-boiled eggs in salad, which was considered common, and was, in fact, ‘not done’ in the best society of Alençon. They affected an attitude of contemptuous irony with regard to a Frenchman who was called ‘His Majesty’ and had indeed proclaimed himself King of a small island in the South Seas, inhabited by a few savages. He was staying in the hotel with his pretty mistress, whom, as she crossed the beach to bathe, the little boys would greet with “Three cheers for the Queen!” because she would reward them with a shower of small silver. The chief magistrate and the barrister went so far as to pretend not to see her, and if any of their friends happened to look at her, felt bound to warn him that she was only a little shop-girl /     “But I was told that at Ostend they used the royal bathing machine.” /     “Well, and why not? It’s on hire for twenty francs. You can take it yourself, if you care for that sort of thing. Anyhow, I know for a fact that the fellow asked for an audience, when he was there, with the King, who sent back word that he took no cognisance of any Pantomime Princes.” “Really, that’s interesting! What queer people there are in the world, to be sure!” /    And I dare say it was all quite true: but it was also from resentment of the thought that, to many of their fellow-visitors, they were themselves simply respectable but rather common people who did not know this King and Queen so prodigal with their small change, that the solicitor, the magistrate, the barrister, when what they were pleased to call the ‘Carnival’ went by, felt so much annoyance, and expressed aloud an indignation that was quite understood by their friend the head waiter who, obliged to shew proper civility to these generous if not authentic Sovereigns, still, while he took their orders, would dart from afar at his old patrons a covert but speaking glance. Perhaps there was also something of the same resentment at being erroneously supposed to be less and unable to explain that they were more smart, underlining the ‘fine specimen’ with which they qualified a young ‘blood,’ the consumptive and dissipated son of an industrial magnate, who appeared every day in a new suit of clothes with an orchid in his buttonhole, drank champagne at luncheon, and then strolled out of the hotel, pale, impassive, a smile of complete indifference on his lips, to the casino to throw away at the baccarat table enormous sums, ‘which he could ill afford to lose,’ as the solicitor said with a resigned air to the chief magistrate, whose wife had it ‘on good authority’ that this ‘detrimental’ young man was bringing his parents’ grey hair in sorrow to the grave /    On the other hand, the barrister and his friends could not exhaust their flow of sarcasm on the subject of a wealthy old lady of title, because she never moved anywhere without taking her whole household with her. Whenever the wives of the solicitor and the magistrate saw her in the dining-room at meal-times they put up their glasses and gave her an insolent scrutiny, as minute and distrustful as if she had been some dish with a pretentious name but a suspicious appearance which, after the negative result of a systematic study, must be sent away with a lofty wave of the hand and a grimace of disgust /    No doubt by this behaviour they meant only to shew that, if there were things in the world which they themselves lacked — in this instance, certain prerogatives which the old lady enjoyed, and the privilege of her acquaintance — it was not because they could not, but because they did not choose to acquire them. But they had succeeded in convincing themselves that this really was what they felt; and it was the suppression of all desire for, of all curiosity as to forms of life which were unfamiliar, of all hope of pleasing new people (for which, in the women, had been substituted a feigned contempt, an artificial brightness) that had the awkward result of obliging them to label their discontent satisfaction, and lie everlastingly to themselves, for which they were greatly to be pitied. But everyone else in the hotel was no doubt behaving in a similar fashion, though his behaviour might take a different form, and sacrificing, if not to self-importance, at any rate to certain inculcated principles and mental habits the thrilling delight of mixing in a strange kind of life. Of course, the atmosphere of the microcosm in which the old lady isolated herself was not poisoned with virulent bitterness, as was that of the group in which the wives of the solicitor and magistrate sat chattering with impotent rage. It was indeed embalmed with a delicate and old-world fragrance which, however, was none the less artificial. For at heart the old lady would probably have found in attracting, in attaching to herself (and, with that object, recreating herself), the mysterious sympathy of new friends a charm which is altogether lacking from the pleasure that is to be derived from mixing only with the people of one’s own world, and reminding oneself that, one’s own being the best of all possible worlds, the ill-informed contempt of ‘outsiders’ may be disregarded. Perhaps she felt that — were she to arriveincognito at the Grand Hotel, Balbec, she would, in her black stuff gown and old-fashioned bonnet, bring a smile to the lips of some old reprobate, who from the depths of his rocking chair would glance up and murmur, “What a scarecrow!” or, still worse, to those of some man of repute who bad, like the magistrate, kept between his pepper-and-salt whiskers a rosy complexion and a pair of sparkling eyes such as she liked to see, and would at once bring the magnifying lens of the conjugal glasses to bear upon so quaint a phenomenon; and perhaps it was in unconfessed dread of those first few minutes, which, though one knows that they will be but a few minutes, are none the less terrifying, like the first plunge of one’s head under water, that this old lady sent down in advance a servant, who would inform the hotel of the personality and habits of his mistress, and, cutting short the manager’s greetings, made, with an abruptness in which there was more timidity than pride, for her room, where her own curtains, substituted for those that draped the hotel windows, her own screens and photographs, set up so effectively between her and the outside world, to which otherwise she would have had to adapt herself, the barrier of her private life that it was her home (in which she had comfortably stayed) that travelled rather than herself /    Thenceforward, having placed between herself, on the one hand, and the staff of the hotel and its decorators on the other the servants who bore instead of her the shock of contact with all this strange humanity, and kept up around their mistress her familiar atmosphere, having set her prejudices between herself and the other visitors, indifferent whether or not she gave offence to people whom her friends would not have had in their houses, it was in her own world that she continued to live, by correspondence with her friends, by memories, by her intimate sense of and confidence in her own position, the quality of her manners, the competence of her politeness. And every day, when she came downstairs to go for a drive in her own carriage, the lady’s-maid who came after her carrying her wraps, the footman who preceded her, seemed like sentries who, at the gate of an embassy, flying the flag of the country to which she belonged, assured to her upon foreign soil the privilege of extra-territoriality. She did not leave her room until late in the afternoon on the day following our arrival, so that we did not see her in the dining-room, into which the manager, since we were strangers there, conducted us, taking us under his wing, as a corporal takes a squad of recruits to the master-tailor, to have them fitted; we did see however, a moment later, a country gentleman and his daughter, of an obscure but very ancient Breton family, M. and Mlle, de Stermaria, whose table had been allotted to us, in the belief that they had gone out and would not be back until the evening. Having come to Balbec only to see various country magnates whom they knew in that neighbourhood, they spent in the hotel dining-room, what with the invitations they accepted and the visits they paid, only such time as was strictly unavoidable. It was their stiffness that preserved them intact from all human sympathy, from interesting at all the strangers seated round about them, among whom M. de Stermaria kept up the glacial, preoccupied, distant, rude, punctilious and distrustful air that we assume in a railway refreshment-room, among fellow-passengers whom we have never seen before and will never see again, and with whom we can conceive of no other relations than to defend from their onslaught our ‘portion’ of cold chicken and our corner seat in the train. No sooner had we begun our luncheon than we were asked to leave the table, on the instructions of M. de Stermaria who had just arrived and, without the faintest attempt at an apology to us, requested the head waiter, in our hearing, to “see that such a mistake did not occur again,” for it was repugnant to him that “people whom he did not know” should have taken his table /    And certainly into the feeling which impelled a young actress (better known, though, for her smart clothes, her smart sayings, her collection of German porcelain, than in the occasional parts that she had played at the Odéon), her lover, an immensely rich young man for whose sake she had acquired her culture, and two sprigs of aristocracy at that time much in the public eye to form a little band apart, to travel only together, to come down to luncheon — when at Balbec — very late, after everyone had finished; to spend the whole day in their sitting-room playing cards, there entered no sort of ill-humour against the rest of us but simply the requirements of the taste that they had formed for a certain type of conversation, for certain refinements of good living, which made them find pleasure in spending their time, in taking their meals only by themselves, and would have rendered intolerable a life in common with people who had not been initiated into those mysteries. Even at a dinner or a card table, each of them had to be certain that, in the diner or partner who sat opposite to him, there was, latent and not yet made use of, a certain brand of knowledge which would enable him to identify the rubbish with which so many houses in Paris were littered as genuine mediaeval or renaissance ‘pieces’ and, whatever the subject of discussion, to apply the critical standards common to all their party whereby they distinguished good work from bad. Probably it was only — at such moments — by some infrequent, amusing interruption flung into the general silence of meal or game, or by the new and charming frock which the young actress had put on for luncheon or for poker, that the special kind of existence in which these four friends desired, above all things, to remain plunged was made apparent. But by engulfing them thus in a system of habits which they knew by heart it sufficed to protect them from the mystery of the life that was going on all round them. All the long afternoon, the sea was suspended there before their eyes only as a canvas of attractive colouring might hang on the wall of a wealthy bachelor’s flat and it was only in the intervals between the ‘hands’ that one of the players, finding nothing better to do, raised his eyes to it to seek from it some indication of the weather or the time, and to remind the others that tea was ready. And at night they did not dine in the hotel, where, hidden springs of electricity flooding the great dining-room with light, it became as it were an immense and wonderful aquarium against whose wall of glass the working population of Balbec, the fishermen and also the tradesmen’s families, clustering invisibly in the outer darkness, pressed their faces to watch, gently floating upon the golden eddies within, the luxurious life of its occupants, a thing as extraordinary to the poor as the life of strange fishes or molluscs (an important social question, this: whether the wall of glass will always protect the wonderful creatures at their feasting, whether the obscure folk who watch them hungrily out of the night will not break in some day to gather them from their aquarium and devour them). Meanwhile there may have been, perhaps, among the gazing crowd, a motionless, formless mass there in the dark, some writer, some student of human ichthyology who, as he watched the jaws of old feminine monstrosities close over a mouthful of food which they proceeded then to absorb, was amusing himself by classifying them according to their race, by their innate characteristics as well as by those acquired characteristics which bring it about that an old Serbian lady whose buccal protuberance is that of a great sea-fish, because from her earliest years she has moved in the fresh waters of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, eats her salad for all the world like a La Rochefoucauld /    At that hour one could see the three young men in dinner-jackets, waiting for the young woman, who was as usual late but presently, wearing a dress that was almost always different and one of a series of scarves, chosen to gratify some special instinct in her lover, after having from her landing rung for the lift, would emerge from it like a doll coming out of its box. And then all four, because they found that the international phenomenon of the ‘Palace,’ planted on Balbec soil, had blossomed there in material splendour rather than in food that was fit to eat, bundled into a carriage and went to dine, a mile off, in a little restaurant that was well spoken of, where they held with the cook himself endless discussions of the composition of their meal and the cooking of its various dishes. During their drive, the road bordered with apple-trees that led out of Balbec was no more to them than the distance that must be traversed — barely distinguishable in the darkness from that which separated their homes in Paris from the Café Anglais or the Tour d’Argent — before they could arrive at the fashionable little restaurant where, while the young man’s friends envied him because he had such a smartly dressed mistress, the latter’s scarves were spread about the little company like a fragrant, flowing veil, but one that kept it apart from the outer world /    Alas for my peace of mind, I had none of the detachment that all these people shewed. To many of them I gave constant thought; I should have liked not to pass unobserved by a man with a receding brow and eyes that dodged between the blinkers of his prejudices and his education, the great nobleman of the district, who was none other than the brother-in-law of Legrandin, and came every now and then to see somebody at Balbec and on Sundays, by reason of the weekly garden-party that his wife and he gave, robbed the hotel of a large number of its occupants, because one or two of them were invited to these entertainments and the others, so as not to appear to have been not invited, chose that day for an expedition to some distant spot. He had had, as it happened, an exceedingly bad reception at the hotel on the first day of the season, when the staff, freshly imported from the Riviera, did not yet know who or what he was. Not only was he not wearing white flannels, but, with old-fashioned French courtesy and in his ignorance of the ways of smart hotels, on coming into the hall in which there were ladies sitting, he had taken off his hat at the door, the effect of which had been that the manager did not so much as raise a finger to his own in acknowledgment, concluding that this must be some one of the most humble extraction, what he called ‘sprung from the ordinary.’ The solicitor’s wife, alone, had felt herself attracted by the stranger, who exhaled all the starched vulgarity of the really respectable, and had declared, with the unerring discernment and the indisputable authority of a person from whom the highest society of Le Mans held no secrets, that one could see at a glance that one was in the presence of a gentleman of great distinction, of perfect breeding, a striking contrast to the sort of people one usually saw at Balbec, whom she condemned as impossible to know so long as she did not know them. This favourable judgment which she had pronounced on Legrandin’s brother-in-law was based perhaps on the spiritless appearance of a man about whom there was nothing to intimidate anyone; perhaps also she had recognised in this gentleman farmer with the gait of a sacristan the Masonic signs of her own inveterate clericalism /    It made no difference my knowing that the young fellows who went past the hotel every day on horseback were the sons of the questionably solvent proprietor of a linen-drapery to whom my father would never have dreamed of speaking; the glamour of ‘seaside life’ exalted them in my eyes to equestrian statues of demi-gods, and the best thing that I could hope for was that they would never allow their proud gaze to fall upon the wretched boy who was myself, who left the hotel dining-room only to sit humbly upon the sands. I should have been glad to arouse some response even from the adventurer who had been king of a desert island in the South Seas, even of the young consumptive, of whom I liked to think that he was hiding beneath his insolent exterior a shy and tender heart, which would perhaps have lavished on me, and on me alone, the treasures of its affection. Besides (unlike what one generally says of the people one meets when travelling) just as being seen in certain company can invest us, in a watering-place to which we shall return another year, with a coefficient that has no equivalent in our true social life, so there is nothing — not which we keep so resolutely at a distance, but — which we cultivate with such assiduity after our return to Paris as the friendships that we have formed by the sea. I was anxious about the opinion that might be held of me by all these temporary or local celebrities whom my tendency to put myself in the place of other people and to reconstruct what was in their minds had made me place not in their true rank, that which they would have held in Paris, for instance, and which would have been quite low, but in that which they must imagine to be, and which indeed was their rank at Balbec, where the want of a common denominator gave them a sort of relative superiority and an individual interest. Alas, none of these people’s contempt for me was so unbearable as that of M. de Stermaria /    For I had noticed his daughter, the moment she came into the room, her pretty features, her pallid, almost blue complexion, what there was peculiar in the carriage of her tall figure, in her gait, which suggested to me — and rightly — her long descent, her aristocratic upbringing, all the more vividly because I knew her name, like those expressive themes composed by musicians of genius which paint in splendid colours the glow of fire, the rush of water, the peace of fields and woods, to audiences who, having first let thçir eyes run over the programme, have their imaginations trained in the right direction. The label ‘Centuries of Breeding,’ by adding to Mlle, de Stermaria’s charms the idea of their origin, made them more desirable also, advertising their rarity as a high price enhances the value of a thing that has already taken our fancy. And its stock of heredity gave to her complexion, in which so many selected juices had been blended, the savour of an exotic fruit or of a famous vintage /    And then mere chance put into our hands, my grandmother’s and mine, the means of giving ourselves an immediate distinction in the eyes of all the other occupants of the hotel. On that first afternoon, at the moment when the old lady came downstairs from her room, producing, thanks to the footman who preceded her, the maid who came running after her with a book and a rug that had been left behind, a marked effect upon all who beheld her and arousing in each of them a curiosity from which it was evident that none was so little immune as M. de Stermaria, the manager leaned across to my grandmother and, from pure kindness of heart (as one might point out the Shah, or Queen Ranavalo to an obscure onlooker who could obviously have no sort of connexion with so mighty a potentate, but might be interested, all the same, to know that he had been standing within a few feet of one) whispered in her ear, “The Marquise de Villeparisis!” while at the same moment the old lady, catching sight of my grandmother,-could not repress a start of pleased surprise /    It may be imagined that the sudden appearance, in the guise of a. little old woman, of the most powerful of fairies would not have given me so much pleasure, destitute as I was of any means of access to Mlle, de Stermaria, in a strange place where I knew no one: no one, that is to say, for any practical purpose. Aesthetically the number of types of humanity is so restricted that we must constantly, wherever we may be, have the pleasure of seeing people we know, even without looking for them in the works of the old masters, like Swann. Thus it happened that in the first few days of our visit to Balbec I had succeeded in finding Legrandin, Swann’s hall porter and Mme. Swann herself, transformed into a waiter, a foreign visitor whom I never saw again and a bathing superintendent. And a sort of magnetism attracts and retains so inseparably, one after another, certain characteristics, facial and mental, that when nature thus introduces a person into a new body she does not mutilate him unduly. Legrandin turned waiter kept intact his stature, the outline of his nose, part of his chin; Mme. Swann, in the masculine gender and the calling of a bathing superintendent, had been accompanied not only by familiar features, but even by the way she had of speaking. Only, she could be of little if any more use to me, standing upon the beach there in the red sash of her office, and hoisting at the first gust of wind the flag which forbade us to bathe (for these superintendents are prudent men, and seldom know how to swim) than she would have been in that fresco of the Life of Moses in which Swann had long ago identified her in the portrait of Jethro’s Daughter. Whereas this Mme. de Villeparisis was her real self, she had not been the victim of an enchantment which had deprived her of her power, but was capable, on the contrary, of putting at the service of my power an enchantment which would multiply it an hundredfold, and thanks to which, as though I had been swept through the air on the wings of a fabulous bird, I was to cross in a few moments the infinitely wide (at least, at Balbec) social gulf which separated me from Mlle, de Stermaria /    Unfortunately, if there was one person in the world who, more than anyone else, lived shut up in a little world of her own, it was my grandmother. She would not, indeed, have despised me, she would simply not have understood what I meant had she been told that I attached importance to the opinions, that I felt an interest in the persons of people the very existence of whom she had never noticed and would, when the time came to leave Balbec, retain no impression of their names. I dared not confess to her that if these same people had seen her talking to Mme. de Villeparisis, I should have been immensely gratified, because I felt that the Marquise counted for much in the hotel and that her friendship would have given us a position in the eyes of Mlle, de Stermaria. Not that my grandmother’s friend represented to me, in any sense of the word, a member of the aristocracy: I was too well used to her name, which had been familiar to my ears before my mind had begun to consider it, when as a child I had heard it occur in conversation at home: while her title added to it only a touch of quaintness — as some uncommon Christian name would have done, or as in the names of streets, among which we can see nothing more noble in the Rue Lord Byron, in the plebeian and even squalid Rue Rochechouart, or in the Rue Grammont than in the Rue Léonce Reynaud or the Rue Hyppolyte Lebas. Mme. de Villeparisis no more made me think of a person who belonged to a special world than did her cousin MacMahon, whom I did not clearly distinguish from M. Carnot, likewise President of the Republic, or from Raspail, whose photograph Françoise had bought with that of Pius IX. It was one of my grandmother’s principles that, when away from home, one should cease to have any social intercourse, that one did not go to the seaside to meet people, having plenty of time for that sort of thing in Paris, that they would make one waste on being merely polite, in pointless conversation, the precious time which ought all to be spent in the open air, beside the waves; and finding it convenient to assume that this view was shared by everyone else, and that it authorised, between old friends whom chance brought face to face in the same hotel, the fiction of a mutual incognito, on hearing her friend’s name from the manager she merely looked the other way, and pretended not to see Mme. de Villeparisis, who, realising that my grandmother did not want to be recognised, looked also into the void. She went past, and I was left in my isolation like a shipwrecked mariner who has seen a vessel apparently coming towards him which has then, without lowering a boat, vanished under the horizon /    She, too, had her meals in the dining-room, but at the other end of it. She knew none of the people who were staying in the hotel, or who came there to call, not even M. de Cambremer; in fact, I noticed that he gave her no greeting, one day when, with his wife, he had accepted an invitation to take luncheon with the barrister, who drunken with the honour of having the nobleman at his table avoided his friends of every day, and confined himself to a distant twitch of the eyelid, so as to draw their attention to this historic event but so discreetly that his signal could not be interpreted by them as an invitation to join the party /     “Well, I hope you’ve got on your best clothes; I hope you feel smart enough,” was the magistrate’s wife’s greeting to him that evening /     “Smart? Why should I?” asked the barrister, concealing his rapture in an exaggerated astonishment. “Because of my guests, do you mean?” he went on, feeling that it was impossible to keep up the farce any longer. “But what is there smart about having a few friends in to luncheon? After all, they must feed somewhere!” /     “But it is smart! They are the de Cambremers, aren’t they? I recognized them at once. She is a Marquise. And quite genuine, too. Not through the females.” /     “Oh, she’s a very simple soul, she is charming, no stand-offishness about her. I thought you were coming to join us. I was making signals to you . . . I would have introduced you!” he asserted, tempering with a hint of irony the vast generosity of the offer, like Ahasuerus when he says to Esther: /                            Of all my Kingdom must I give you half! / “No, no, no, no! We lie hidden, like the modest violet.” /     “But you were quite wrong, I assure you,” replied the barrister, growing bolder now that the danger point was passed. “They weren’t going to eat you. I say, aren’t we going to have our little game of bezique?” /     “Why, of course! We were afraid to suggest it, now that you go about entertaining Marquises.” /     “Oh, get along with you; there’s nothing so very wonderful about them, Why, I’m dining there to-morrow. Would you care to go instead of me? I mean it. Honestly, I’d just as soon stay here.” /     “No, no! I should be removed from the bench as a Reactionary,” cried the chief magistrate, laughing till the tears stood in his eyes at his own joke. “But you go to Féterne too, don’t you?” he went on, turning to the solicitor /     “Oh, I go there on Sundays — in at one door and out at the other. But I don’t have them here to luncheon, like the Leader.” M. de Stermaria was not at Balbec that day, to the barrister’s great regret. But he managed to say a word in season to the head waiter: /     “Aimé, you can tell M. de Stermaria that he’s not the only nobleman you’ve had in here. You saw the gentleman who was with me to-day at luncheon? Eh? A small moustache, looked like a military man. Well, that was the Marquis de Cambremer!” /     “Was it indeed? I’m not surprised to hear it.” /     “That will shew him that he’s not the only man who’s got a title. That will teach him! It’s not a bad thing to take ’em down a peg or two, those noblemen. I say, Aimé, don’t say anything to him unless you like: I mean to say, it’s no business of mine; besides, they know each other already.” /    And next day M. de Stermaria, who remembered that the barrister had once held a brief for one of his friends, came up and introduced himself /     “Our friends in common, the de Cambremers, were anxious that we should meet; the days didn’t fit; I don’t know quite what went wrong —” stammered the barrister, who, like most liars, imagined that other people do not take the trouble to investigate an unimportant detail which, for all that, may be sufficient (if chance puts you in possession of the humble facts of the case, and they contradict it) to shew the liar in his true colours and to inspire a lasting mistrust /    Then as at all times, but more easily now that her father had left her and was talking to the barrister, I was gazing at Mlle, de Stermaria. No less than the bold and always graceful originality of her attitudes, as when, leaning her elbows on the table, she raised her glass in both hands over her outstretched arms, the dry flame of a glance at once extinguished, the ingrained, congenital hardness that one could feel, ill-concealed by her own personal inflexions, in the sound of her voice, which had shocked my grandmother; a sort of atavistic starting point to which she recoiled whenever, by glance or utterance, she had succeeded in expressing a thought of her own; all of these qualities carried the mind of him who watched her back to the line of ancestors who had bequeathed to her that inadequacy of human sympathy, those blanks in her sensibility, that short measure of humanity which was at every moment running out. But from a certain look which flooded for a moment the wells — instantly dry again — of her eyes, a look in which I could discern that almost obsequious docility which the predominance of a taste for sensual pleasures gives to the proudest of women, who will soon come to recognise but one form of personal distinction, that namely which any man enjoys who can make her feel those pleasures, an actor, an acrobat even, for whom, perhaps, she will one day leave her husband; — from a certain rosy tint, warm and sensual, which flushed her pallid cheeks, like the colour that stained the hearts of the white water-lilies in the Vivonne, I thought I could discern that she would readily have consented to my coming to seek in her the savour of that life of poetry and romance which she led in Brittany, a life to which, whether from over-familiarity or from innate superiority, or from disgust at the penury or the avarice of her family, she seemed not to attach any great value, but which, for all that, she held enclosed in her body. In the meagre stock of will-power that had been transmitted to her, and gave an element of weakness to her expression, she would not perhaps have found the strength to resist. And, crowned by a feather that was a trifle old-fashioned and pretentious, the grey felt hat which she invariably wore at meals made her all the more attractive to me, not because it was in harmony with her pearly or rosy complexion, but because, by making me suppose her to be poor, it brought her closer to myself. Obliged by her father’s presence to adopt a conventional attitude, but already bringing to the perception and classification of the people who passed before her eyes other principles than his, perhaps she saw in me not my humble rank, but the right sex and age. If one day M. de Stermaria had gone out leaving her behind, if, above all, Mme. de Villeparisis, by coming to sit at our table, had given her an opinion of me which might have emboldened me to approach her, perhaps then we might have contrived to exchange a few words, to arrange a meeting, to form a closer tie. And for a whole month during which she would be left alone, without her parents, in her romantic Breton castle, we should perhaps have been able to wander by ourselves at evening, she and I together in the dusk which would shew in a softer light above the darkening water pink briar roses, beneath oak trees beaten and stunted by the hammering of the waves. Together we should have roamed that isle impregnated with so intense a charm for me because it had enclosed the everyday life of Mlle, de Stermaria and lay at rest in her remembering eyes. For it seemed to me that I should not really have possessed her save there, when I should have traversed those regions which enveloped her in so many memories — a veil which my desire sought to tear apart, one of those veils which nature interposes between woman and her pursuers (with the same intention as when, for all of us, she places the act of reproduction between ourselves and our keenest pleasure, and for insects, places before the nectar the pollen which they must carry away with them) in order that, tricked by the illusion of possessing her thus more completely, they may be forced to occupy first the scenes among which she lives, and which, of more service to their imagination than sensual pleasure can be, yet would not without that pleasure have had the power to attract them /    But I was obliged to take my eyes from Mlle, de Stermaria, for already, considering no doubt that making the acquaintance of an important person was a brief, inquisitive act which was sufficient in itself, and to bring out all the interest that was latent in it required only a handshake and a penetrating stare, without either immediate conversation or any subsequent relations, her father had taken leave of the barrister and returned to sit down facing her, rubbing his hands like a man who has just made a valuable acquisition. As for the barrister, once the first emotion of this interview had subsided, then, as on other days, he could be heard every minute addressing the head waiter: /     “But I am not a king, Aimé; go and attend to the king! I say, Chief, those little trout don’t look at all bad, do they? We must ask Aimé to let us have some. Aimé, that little fish you have over there looks to me highly commendable; will you bring us some, please, Aimé, and don’t be sparing with it?” /    He would repeat the name ‘Aimé’ all day long, one result of which was that when he had anyone to dinner the guest would remark “I can see, you are quite at home in this place,” and would feel himself obliged to keep, on saying ‘Aimé’ also, from that tendency, combining elements of timidity, vulgarity and silliness, which many people have, to believe that it is smart and witty to copy to the letter what is said by the company in which they may happen to be. The barrister repeated the name incessantly, but with a smile, for he felt that he was exhibiting at once the good terms on which he stood with the head waiter and his own superior station. And the head waiter, whenever he caught the sound of his own name, smiled too, as though touched and at the same time proud, shewing that he was conscious of the honour and could appreciate the pleasantry /    Terrifying as I always found these meals, in the vast restaurant, generally full, of the mammoth hotel, they became even more terrifying when there arrived for a few days the Proprietor (or he may have been only the General Manager, appointed by a board of directors) not only of this ‘palace’ but of seven or eight more besides, situated at all the four corners of France, in each of which, travelling continuously, he would spend a week now and again. Then, just after dinner had begun, there appeared every evening in the doorway of the dining-room this small man with white hair and a red nose, astonishingly neat and impassive, who was known, it appeared, as well in London as at Monte-Carlo, as one of the leading hotel-keepers in Europe. Once when I had gone out for a moment at the beginning of dinner, as I came in again I passed close by him, and he bowed to me, but with a coldness in which I could not distinguish whether it should be attributed to the reserve of a man who could never forget what he was, or to his contempt for a customer of so little importance. To those whose importance was considerable the Managing Director would bow, with quite as much coldness but more deeply, lowering his eyelids with a reverence that was almost offended modesty, as though he had found himself confronted, at a funeral, with the father of the deceased or with the Blessed Sacrament. Except for these icy and infrequent salutations, he made not the slightest movement, as if to show that his glittering eyes, which appeared to be starting out of his head, saw everything, controlled everything, assured to us in the ‘Hotel dinner’ perfection in every detail as well as a general harmony. He felt, evidently, that he was more than the producer of a play, than the conductor of an orchestra, nothing less than a general in supreme command. Having decided that a contemplation carried to its utmost intensity would suffice to assure him that everything was in readiness, that no mistake had been made which could lead to disaster — to invest him, in a word, with full responsibility, he abstained not merely from any gesture but even from moving his eyes, which, petrified by the intensity of their gaze, took in and directed everything that was going on. I felt that even the movements of my spoon did not escape him, and were he to vanish after the soup, for the whole of dinner the review that he had held would have taken away my appetite. His own was exceedingly good, as one could see at luncheon, which he took like an ordinary guest of the hotel at a table that anyone else might have had in the public dining-room. His table had this peculiarity only, that by his side, while he was eating, the other manager, the resident one, remained standing all the time to make conversation. For being subordinate to this Managing Director he was anxious to please a man of whom he lived in constant fear. My fear of him diminished during these luncheons, for being then lost in the crowd of visitors he would exercise the discretion of a general sitting in a restaurant where there are also private soldiers, in not seeming to take any notice of them. Nevertheless when the porter, from among a cluster of pages, announced to me: “He leaves to-morrow morning for Dinard. Then he’s going down to Biarritz, and after that to Cannes,” I began to breathe more freely /    My life in the hotel was rendered not only dull because I had no friends there but uncomfortable because Françoise had made so many. It might be thought that they would have made things easier for us in various respects. Quite the contrary. The proletariat, if they succeeded only with great difficulty in being treated as people she knew by Françoise, and could not succeed at all unless they fulfilled the condition of shewing the utmost politeness to her, were, on the other hand, once they had reached the position, the only people who ‘counted.’ Her time-honoured code taught her that she was in no way bound to the friends of her employers, that she might, if she was busy, shut the door without ceremony in the face of a lady who had come to call on my grandmother. But towards her own acquaintance, that is to say, the select handful of the lower orders whom she admitted to an unconquerable intimacy, her actions were regulated by the most subtle and most stringent of protocols. Thus Françoise having made the acquaintance of the man in the coffee-shop and of a little maid who did dressmaking for a Belgian lady, no longer came upstairs immediately after luncheon to get my grandmother’s things ready, but came an hour later, because the coffee man had wanted to make her a cup of coffee or a tisane in his shop, or the maid had invited her to go and watch her sew, and to refuse either of them would have been impossible, and one of the things that were not done. Moreover, particular attention was due to the little sewing-maid, who was an orphan and had been brought up by strangers to whom she still went occasionally for a few days’ holiday. Her unusual situation aroused Franchise’s pity, and also a benevolent contempt. She, who had a family, a little house that had come to her from her parents, with a field in which her brother kept his cows, how could she regard so uprooted a creature as her equal? And since this girl hoped, on Assumption Day, to be allowed to pay her benefactors a visit, Françoise kept on repeating: “She does make me laugh! She says, ‘I hope to be going home for the Assumption.’ ‘Home!’ says she! It isn’t just that it’s not her own place, they’re people who took her in from nowhere, and the creature says ‘home’ just as if it really was her home. Poor girl! What a wretched state she must be in, not to know what it is to have a home.” Still, if Françoise had associated only with the ladies’-maids brought to the hotel by other visitors, who fed with her in the ‘service’ quarters and, seeing her grand lace cap and her handsome profile, took her perhaps for some lady of noble birth, whom ‘reduced circumstances,’ or a personal attachment had driven to serve as companion to my grandmother, if in a word Françoise had known only people who did not belong to the hotel, no great harm would have been done, since she could not have prevented them from doing us any service, for the simple reason that in no circumstances, even without her knowledge, would it have been possible for them to serve us at all. But she had formed connexions also with one of the wine waiters, with a man in the kitchen, and with the head chambermaid of our landing. And the result of this in our everyday life was that Françoise, who on the day of her arrival, when she still did not know anypne, would set all the bells jangling for the slightest thing, at an hour when my grandmother and I would never have dared to ring, and if we offered some gentle admonition answered: “Well, we’re paying enough for it, aren’t we?” as though it were she herself that would have to pay; nowadays, since she had made friends with a personage in the kitchen, which had appeared to us to augur well for our future comfort, were my grandmother or I to complain of cold feet, Françoise, even at an hour that was quite normal, dared not ring; she assured us that it would give offence because they would have to light the furnace again, or because it would interrupt the servants’ dinner and they would be annoyed. And she ended with a formula that, in spite of the ambiguous way in which she uttered it, was none the less clear, and put us plainly in the wrong: “The fact is . . . ” We did not insist, for fear of bringing upon ourselves another, far more serious: “It’s a matter . . .!” So that it amounted to this, that we could no longer have any hot water because Françoise had become a friend of the man who would have to heat it /    In the end we too formed a connexion, in spite of but through my grandmother, for she and Mme. de Villeparisis came in collision one morning in a doorway and were obliged to accost each other, not without having first exchanged gestures of surprise and hesitation, performed movements of recoil and uncertainty, and finally uttered protestations of joy and greeting, as in some of Molière’s plays, where two actors who have been delivering long soliloquies from opposite sides of the stage, a few feet apart, are supposed not to have seen each other yet, and then suddenly catch sight of each other, cannot believe their eyes, break off what they are saying and finally address each other (the chorus having meanwhile kept the dialogue going) and fall into each other’s arms. Mme. de Villeparisis was tactful, and made as if to leave my grandmother to herself after the first greetings, but my grandmother insisted on her staying to talk to her until luncheon, being anxious to discover how her friend managed to get her letters sent up to her earlier than we got ours, and to get such nice grilled things (for Mme. de Villeparisis, a great epicure, had the poorest opinion of the hotel kitchen which served us with meals that my grandmother, still quoting Mme. de Sévigné, described as “of a magnificence to make you die of hunger.”) And the Marquise formed the habit of coming every day, until her own meal was ready, to sit down for a moment at our table in the dining-room, insisting that we should not rise from our chairs or in any way put ourselves out. At the most we would linger, as often as not, in the room after finishing our luncheon, to talk to her, at that sordid moment when the knives are left littering the tablecloth among crumpled napkins. For my own part, so as to preserve (in order that I might be able to enjoy Balbec) the idea that I was on the uttermost promontory of the earth, I compelled myself to look farther afield, to notice only the sea, to seek in it the effects described by Baudelaire and to let my gaze fall upon our table only on days when there was set on it some gigantic fish, some marine monster, which unlike the knives and forks was contemporary with the primitive epochs in which the Ocean first began to teem with life, in the Cimmerians’ time, a fish whose body with its numberless vertebrae, its blue veins and red, had been constructed by nature, but according to an architectural plan, like a polychrome cathedral of the deep /    As a barber, seeing an officer whom he is accustomed to shave with special deference and care recognise a customer who has just entered the shop and stop for a moment to talk to him, rejoices in the thought that these are two men of the same social order, and cannot help smiling as he goes to fetch the bowl of soap, for he knows that in his establishment,’ to the vulgar routine of a mere barber’s-shop, are being added social, not to say aristocratic pleasures, so Aimé, seeing that Mme. de Villeparisis had found in us old friends, went to fetch our finger-bowls with precisely the smile, proudly modest and knowingly discreet, of a hostess who knows when to leave her guests to themselves. He suggested also a pleased and loving father who looks on, without interfering, at the happy pair who have plighted their troth at his hospitable board. Besides, it was enough merely to utter the name of a person of title for Aimé to appear pleased, unlike Françoise, before whom you could not mention Count So-and-so without her face darkening and her speech becoming dry and sharp, all of which meant that she worshipped the aristocracy not less than Aimé but far more. But then Françoise had that quality which in others she condemned as the worst possible fault; she was proud. She was not of that friendly and good-humoured race to which Aimé belonged. They feel, they exhibit an intense delight when you tell them a piece of news which may be more or less sensational but is at any rate new, and not to be found in the papers. Françoise declined to appear surprised. You might have announced in her hearing that the Archduke Rudolf — not that she had the least suspicion of his having ever existed — was not, as was generally supposed, dead, but ‘alive and kicking’; she would have answered only ‘Yes,’ as though she had known it all the time. It may, however, have been that if even from our own lips, from us whom she so meekly called her masters, who had so nearly succeeded in taming her, she could not, without having to check an angry start, hear the name of a noble, that was because the family from which she had sprung occupied in its own village a comfortable and independent position, and was not to be threatened in the consideration which it enjoyed save by those same nobles, in whose households, meanwhile, from his boyhood, an Aimé would have been domiciled as a servant, if not actually brought up by their charity. Of Françoise, then, Mme. de Villeparisis must ask pardon, first, for her nobility. But (in France, at any rate) that is precisely the talent, in fact the sole occupation of our great gentlemen and ladies. Françoise, following the common tendency of servants, who pick up incessantly from the conversation of their masters with other people fragmentary observations from which they are apt to draw erroneous inductions, as the human race generally does with respect to the habits of animals, was constantly discovering that somebody had ‘failed’ us, a conclusion to which she was easily led, not so much, perhaps, by her extravagant love for us, as by the delight that she took in being disagreeable to us. But having once established, without possibility of error, the endless little attentions paid to us, and paid to herself also by Mme. de Villeparisis, Françoise forgave her for being a Marquise, and, as she had never ceased to be proud of her because she was one, preferred her thenceforward to all our other friends. It must be added that no one else took the trouble to be so continually nice to us. Whenever my grandmother remarked on a book that Mme. de Villeparisis was reading, or said she had been admiring the fruit which some one had just sent to our friend, within an hour the footman would come to our rooms with book or fruit. And the next time we saw her, in response to our thanks, she would say only, seeming to seek some excuse for the meagreness of her present in some special use to which it might be put: “It’s nothing wonderful, but the newspapers come so late here, one must have something to read.” Or, “It is always wiser to have fruit one can be quite certain of, at the seaside.”—“But I don’t believe I’ve ever seen you eating oysters,” she said to us, increasing the sense of disgust which I felt at that moment, for the living flesh of the oyster revolted me even more than the gumminess of the stranded jellyfish defiled for me the beach at Balbec; “they are delicious down here! Oh, let me tell my maid to fetch your letters when she goes for mine. What, your daughter writes every day? But what on earth can you find to say to each other?” My grandmother was silent, but it may be assumed that her silence was due to scorn, in her who used to repeat, when she wrote to Mamma, the words of Mme. de Sévigné: “As soon as I have received a letter, I want another at once; I cannot breathe until it comes. There are few who are worthy to understand what I mean.” And I was afraid of her applying to Mme. de Villeparisis the conclusion: “I seek out those who are of the chosen few, and I avoid the rest.” She fell back upon praise of the fruit which Mme. de Villeparisis had sent us the day before. And this had been, indeed, so fine that the manager, in spite of the jealousy aroused by our neglect of his official offerings, had said to me: “I am like you; I’m madder about fruit than any other kind of dessert.” My grandmother told her friend that she had enjoyed them all the more because the fruit which we got in the hotel was generally horrid. “I cannot,” she went on, “say, like Mme. de Sévigné, that if we should take a sudden fancy for bad fruit we should be obliged to order it from Paris.” “Oh yes, of course, you read Mme. de Sévigné. I saw you with her letters the day you came.” (She forgot that she had never officially seen my grandmother in the hotel until their collision in the doorway.) “Don’t you find it rather exaggerated, her constant anxiety about her daughter? She refers to it too often to be really sincere. She is not natural.” My grandmother felt that any discussion would be futile, and so as not to be obliged to speak of the things she loved to a person incapable of understanding them, concealed by laying her bag upon them the Mémoires de Mme. de Beausergent /    Were she to encounter Françoise at the moment (which Françoise called ‘the noon’) when, wearing her fine cap and surrounded with every mark of respect, she was coming downstairs to ‘feed with the service,’ Mme. Villeparisis would stop her to ask after us. And Françoise, when transmitting to us the Marquise’s message: “She said to me, ‘You’ll be sure and bid them good day,’ she said,” counterfeited the voice of Mme. de Villeparisis, whose exact words she imagined herself to be quoting textu-ally, whereas she was really corrupting them no less than Plato corrupts the words of Socrates or Saint John the words of Jesus. Françoise, as was natural, was deeply touched by these attentions. Only she did not believe my grandmother, but supposed that she must be lying in the interest of her class (the rich always combining thus to support one another) when she assured us that Mme. de Villeparisis had been lovely as a young woman. It was true that of this loveliness only the faintest trace remained, from which no one — unless he happened to be a great deal more of an artist than Françoise — would have been able to restore her ruined beauty. For in order to understand how beautiful an elderly woman can once have been one must not only study but interpret every line of her face /     “I must remember, some time, to ask her whether I’m not right, after all, in thinking that there is some connexion with the Guermantes,” said my grandmother, to my great indignation. How could I be expected to believe in a common origin uniting two names which had entered my consciousness, one through the low and shameful gate of experience, the other by the golden gate of imagination? /    We had several times, in the last few days, seen driving past us in a stately equipage, tall, auburn, handsome, with a rather prominent nose, the Princesse de Luxembourg, who was staying in the neighbourhood for a few weeks. Her carriage had stopped outside the hotel, a footman had come in and spoken to the manager, had gone back to the carriage and had reappeared with the most amazing armful of fruit (which combined in a single basket, like the bay itself, different seasons) with a card: “La Princesse de Luxembourg,” on which were scrawled a few words in pencil. For what princely traveller sojourning here incognito, could they be intended, those glaucous plums, luminous and spherical as was at that moment the circumfluent sea, transparent grapes clustering on a shrivelled stick, like a fine day in autumn, pears of a heavenly ultramarine? For it could not be on my grandmother’s friend that the Princess had meant to pay a call. And yet on the following evening Mme. de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of grapes, cool, liquid, golden; plums too and pears which we remembered, though the plums had changed, like the sea at our dinner-hour, to a dull purple, and on the ultramarine surface of the pears there floated the forms of a few rosy clouds. A few days later we met Mme. de Villeparisis as we came away from the symphony concert that was given every morning on the beach. Convinced that the music to which I had been listening (the Prelude to Lohengrin, the Overture to Tannhäuser and suchlike) expressed the loftiest of truths, I was trying to elevate myself, as far as I could, so as to attain to a comprehension of them, I was extracting from myself so as to understand them, and was attributing to them, all that was best and most profound in my own nature at that time /    Well, as we came out of the concert, and, on our way back to the hotel, had stopped for a moment on the ‘front,’ my grandmother and I, for a few words with Mme. de Villeparisis who told us that she had ordered somecroque-monsieurs and a dish of creamed eggs for us at the hotel, I saw, a long way away, coming in our direction, the Princesse de Luxembourg, half leaning upon a parasol in such a way as to impart to her tall and wonderful form that slight inclination, to make it trace that arabesque dear to the women who had been beautiful under the Empire, and knew how, with drooping shoulders, arched backs, concave hips and bent limbs, to make their bodies float as gently as a silken scarf about the rigidity of the invisible stem which might be supposed to have been passed diagonally through them. She went out every morning for a turn on the beach almost at the time when everyone else, after bathing, was climbing home to luncheon, and as hers was not until half past one she did not return to her villa until long after the hungry bathers had left the scorching ‘front’ a desert. Mme. de Villeparisis presented my grandmother and would have presented me, but had first to ask me my name, which she could not remember. She had, perhaps, never known it, or if she had must have forgotten years ago to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. My name, when she did hear it, appeared to impress Mme. de Villeparisis considerably. Meanwhile the Princesse de Luxembourg had given us her hand and, now and again, while she conversed with the Marquise, turned to bestow a kindly glance on my grandmother and myself, with that embryonic kiss which we put into our smiles when they are addressed to a baby out with its ‘Nana.’ Indeed, in her anxiety not to appear to be a denizen of a higher sphere than ours, she had probably miscalculated the distance there was indeed between us, for by an error in adjustment she made her eyes beam with such benevolence that I could see the moment approaching when she would put out her hand and stroke us, as if we were two nice beasts and had poked our heads out at her through the bars of our cage in the Gardens. And, immediately, as it happened, this idea of caged animals and the Bois de Boulogne received striking confirmation. It was the time of day at which the beach is crowded by itinerant and clamorous vendors, hawking cakes and sweets and biscuits. Not knowing quite what to do to shew her affection for us, the Princess hailed the next that came by; he had nothing left but one rye-cake, of the kind one throws to the ducks. The Princess took it and said to me: “For your grandmother.” And yet it was to me that she held it out, saying with a friendly smile, “You shall give it to her yourself!” thinking that my pleasure would thus be more complete if there were no intermediary between myself and the animals. Other vendors came up; she stuffed my pockets with everything that they had, tied up in packets, comfits, sponge-cakes, sugar-sticks. “You will eat some yourself,” she told me, “and give some to your grandmother,” and she had the vendors paid by the little Negro page, dressed in red satin, who followed her everywhere and was a nine days’ wonder upon the beach. Then she said good-bye to Mme. de Villeparisis and held out her hand to us with the intention of treating us in the same way as she treated her friend, as people whom she knew, and of bringing herself within our reach. But this time she must have reckoned our level as not quite so low in the scale of creation, for her and our equality was indicated by the Princess to my grandmother by that tender and maternal smile which a woman gives a little boy when she says good-bye to him as though to a grown-up person. By a miraculous stride in evolution, my grandmother was no longer a duck or an antelope, but had already become what the anglophil Mme. Swann would have called a ‘baby.’ Finally, having taken leave of us all, the Princess resumed her stroll along the basking ‘front,’ curving her splendid shape which, like a serpent coiled about a wand, was interlaced with the white parasol patterned in blue which Mme. de Luxembourg held, unopened, in her hand. She was my first Royalty — I say my first, for strictly speaking Princesse Mathilde did not count. The second, as we shall see in due course, was to astonish me no less by her indulgence. One of the ways in which our great nobles, kindly intermediaries between commoners and kings, can befriend us was revealed to me next day when Mme. de Villeparisis reported: “She thought you quite charming. She is a woman of the soundest judgment, the warmest heart. Not like so many Queens and people! She has real merit.” And Mme. de Villeparisis went on in a tone of conviction, and quite thrilled to be able to say it to us: “I am sure she would be delighted to see you again.” /    But on that previous morning, after we had parted from the Princesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis said a thing which impressed me far more and was not prompted merely by friendly feeling /     “Are you,” she had asked me, “the son of the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry? Indeed! I am told your father is a most charming man. He is having a splendid holiday just now.” /    A few days earlier we had heard, in a letter from Mamma, that my father and his friend M. de Norpois had lost their luggage /     “It has been found; as a matter of fact, it was never really lost, I can tell you what happened,” explained Mme. de Villeparisis, who, without our knowing how, seemed to be far better informed than ourselves of the course of my father’s travels. “I think your father is now planning to come home earlier, next week, in fact, as he will probably give up the idea of going to Algeciras. But he is anxious to devote a day longer to Toledo; it seems, he is an admirer of a pupil of Titian — I forget the name — whose work can only be seen properly there.” /    I asked myself by what strange accident, in the impartial glass through which Mme. de Villeparisis considered, from a safe distance, the bustling, tiny, purposeless agitation of the crowd of people whom she knew, there had come to be inserted at the spot through which she observed rhy father a fragment of prodigious magnifying power which made her see in such high relief and in the fullest detail everything that there was attractive about him, the contingencies that were obliging him to return home, his difficulties with the customs, his admiration for El Greco, and, altering the scale of her vision, shewed her this one man so large among all the rest quite small, like that Jupiter to whom Gustave Moreau gave, when he portrayed him by the side of a weak mortal, a superhuman stature /    My grandmother bade Mme. de Villeparisis good-bye, so that we might stay and imbibe the fresh air for a little while longer outside the hotel, until they signalled to us through the glazed partition that our luncheon was ready. There were sounds of tumult. The young mistress of the King of the Cannibal Island had been down to bathe and was now coming back to the hotel /     “Really and truly, it’s a perfect plague: it’s enough to make one decide to emigrate!” cried the barrister, who had happened to cross her path, in a towering rage /    Meanwhile the solicitor’s wife was following the bogus Queen with eyes that seemed ready to start from their sockets /     “I can’t tell you how angry Mme. Blandais makes me when she stares at those people like that,” said the barrister to the chief magistrate, “I feel I want to slap her. That is just the way to make the wretches appear important; and of course that’s the very thing they want, that people should take an interest in them. Do ask her husband to tell her what a fool she’s making of herself. I swear I won’t go out with them again if they stop and gape at those masqueraders.” /    As to the coming of the Princesse de Luxembourg, whose carriage, on the day on which she left the fruit, had drawn up outside the hotel, it had not passed unobserved by the little group of wives, the solicitor’s, the barrister’s and the magistrate’s, who had for some time past been most concerned to know whether she was a genuine Marquise and not an adventuress, that Mme. de Villeparisis whom everyone treated with so much respect, which all these ladies were burning to hear that she did not deserve. Whenever Mme. de Villeparisis passed through the hall the chief magistrate’s wife, who scented irregularities everywhere, would raise her eyes from her ‘work’ and stare at the intruder in a way that made her friends die of laughter /     “Oh, well, you know,” she explained with lofty condescension, “I always begin by believing the worst. I will never admit that a woman is properly married until she has shewn me her birth certificate and her marriage lines. But there’s no need to alarm yourselves; just wait till I’ve finished my little investigation.” /    And so, day after day the ladies would come together, and, laughingly, ask one another: “Any news?” /    But on the evening after the Princesse de Luxembourg’s call the magistrate’s wife laid a finger on her lips /     “I’ve discovered something.” /     “Oh, isn’t Mme. Poncin simply wonderful? I never saw anyone. . . . But do tell us! What has happened?” /     “Just listen to this. A woman with yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage like a — you could smell it a mile off; which only a creature like that would dare to have — came here to-day to call on the Marquise, by way of!” /     “Oh-yow-yow! Tut-tut-tut-tut. Did you ever! Why, it must be that woman we saw — you remember, Leader — we said at the time we didn’t at all like the look of her, but we didn’t know that it was the ‘Marquise’ sheîd come to see. A woman with a nigga-boy, you mean?” /     “That’s the one.” /     “D’you mean to say so? You don’t happen to know her name?” /     “Yes, I made a mistake on purpose; I picked up her card; she tradesunder the name of the ‘Princesse de Luxembourg!’ Wasn’t I right to have my doubts about her? It’s a nice thing to have to mix promiscuously with a Baronne d’Ange like that?” The barrister quoted Mathurin Régnier’sMacette to the chief magistrate /    It must not, however, be supposed that this misunderstanding was merely temporary, like those that occur in the second act of a farce to be cleared up before the final curtain. Mme. de Luxembourg, a niece of the King of England and of the Emperor of Austria, and Mme. de Villeparisis, when one called to take the other for a drive, did look like nothing but two ‘old trots’ of the kind one has always such difficulty in avoiding at a watering place. Nine tenths of the men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain appear to the average man of the middle class simply as alcoholic wasters (which, individually, they not infrequently are) whom, therefore, no respectable person would dream of asking to dinner. The middle class fixes its standard, in this respect, too high, for the feelings of these men would never prevent their being received with every mark of esteem in houses which it, the middle class, may never enter. And so sincerely do they believe that the middle class knows this that they affect a simplicity in speaking of their own affairs and a tone of disparagement of their friends, especially when they are ‘at the coast,’ which make the misunderstanding complete. If, by any chance, a man of the fashionable world is kept in touch with ‘business people’ because, having more money than he knows what to do with, he finds himself elected chairman of all sorts of important financial concerns, the business man who at last sees a nobleman worthy, he considers, to rank with ‘big business,’ would take his oath that such a man can have no dealings with the Marquis ruined by gambling whom the said business man supposes to be all the more destitute of friends the more friendly he makes himself. And he cannot get over his surprise when the Duke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the colossal undertaking, arranges a marriage for his son with the daughter of that very Marquis, who may be a gambler but who bears the oldest name in France, just as a Sovereign would sooner see his son marry the daughter of a dethroned King than that of a President still in office. That is to say, the two worlds take as fantastic! a view of one another as the inhabitants of a town situated at one end of Balbec Bay have of the town at the other end: from Rivebelle you can just see Marcouville l’Orgueilleuse; but even that is deceptive, for you imagine that you are seen from Marcouville, where, as a matter of fact, the splendours of Rive-belle are almost wholly invisible /    The Balbec doctor, who had been called in to cope with a sudden feverish attack, having given the opinion that I ought not to stay out all day on the beach, in the blazing sun, without shelter, and having written out various prescriptions for my use, my grandmother took his prescriptions with a show of respect in which I could at once discern her firm resolve not to have any of them ‘made up,’ but did pay attention to his advice on the matter of hygiene, and accepted an offer from Mme. de Villeparisis to take us for drives in her carriage. After this I would spend the mornings, until luncheon, going to and fro between my own room and my grandmother’s. Hers did not look out directly upon the sea, as mine did, but was lighted from three of its four sides — with views of a strip of the ‘front,’ of a well inside the building, and of the country inland, and was furnished differently from mine, with armchairs upholstered in a metallic tissue with red flowers from which seemed to emanate the cool and pleasant odour that greeted me when I entered the room. And at that hour when the sun’s rays, coming from different aspects and, as it were, from different hours of the day, broke the angles of the wall, thrust in a reflexion of the beach, made of the chest of drawers a festal altar, variegated as a bank of field-flowers, attached to the wall the wings, folded, quivering, warm, of a radiance that would, at any moment, resume its flight, warmed like a bath a square of provincial carpet before the window overlooking the well, which the sun festooned and patterned like a climbing vine, added to the charm and complexity of the room’s furniture by seeming to pluck and scatter the petals of the silken flowers on the chairs, and to make their silver threads stand out from the fabric, this room in which I lingered for a moment before going to get ready for our drive suggested a prism in which the colours of the light that shone outside were broken up, or a hive in which the sweet juices of the day which I was about to taste were distilled, scattered, intoxicating, visible, a garden of hope which dissolved in a quivering haze of silver threads and rose leaves. But before all this I had drawn back my own curtains, impatient to know what Sea it was that was playing that morning by the shore, like a Nereid. For none of those Seas ever stayed with us longer than a day. On the morrow there would be another, which sometimes resembled its predecessor. But I never saw the same one twice /    There were some that were of so rare a beauty that my pleasure on catching sight of them was enhanced by surprise. By what privilege, on one morning rather than another, did the window on being uncurtained disclose to my wondering eyes the nymph Glauconome, whose lazy beauty, gently breathing, had the transparence of a vaporous emerald beneath whose surface I could see teeming the ponderable elements that coloured it? She made the sun join in her play, with a smile rendered languorous by an invisible haze which was nought but a space kept vacant about her translucent surface, which, thus curtailed, became more appealing, like those goddesses whom the sculptor carves in relief upon a block of marble, the rest of which he leaves unchiselled. So, in her matchless colour, she invited us out over those rough terrestrial roads, from which, seated beside Mme. de Villeparisis in her barouche, we should see, all day long and without ever reaching it, the coolness of her gentle palpitation /    Mme. de Villeparisis used to order her carriage early, so that we should have time to reach Saint-Mars le Vêtu, or the rocks of Quetteholme, or some other goal which, for a somewhat lumbering vehicle, was far enough off to require the whole day. In my joy at the long drive we were going to take I would be humming some tune that I had heard recently as I strolled up and down until Mme. de Villeparisis was ready. If it was Sunday hers would not be the only carriage drawn up outside the hotel; several hired flies would be waiting there, not only for the people who had been invited to Féterne by Mme. de Cambremer, but for those who, rather than stay at home all day, like children in disgrace, declared that Sunday was always quite impossible at Balbec and started off immediately after luncheon to hide themselves in some neighbouring watering-place or to visit one of the ‘sights’ of the district. And indeed whenever (which was often) anyone asked Mme. Blandais if she had been to the Cambremers’, she would answer peremptorily: “No; we went to the Falls of the Bee,” as though that were the sole reason for her not having spent the day at Féteme. And the barrister would be charitable, and say: /     “I envy you. I wish I had gone there instead; they must be well worth seeing.” /    Beside the row of carriages, in front of the porch in which I stood waiting, was planted, like some shrub of a rare species, a young page who attracted the eye no less by the unusual and effective colouring of his hair than by his plant-like epidermis. Inside, in the hall, corresponding to the narthex, or Church of the Catechumens in a primitive basilica, through which persons who were not staying in the hotel were entitled to pass, the comrades of this ‘outside’ page did not indeed work much harder than he but did at least execute certain drilled movements. It is probable that in the early morning they helped with the cleaning. But in the afternoon they stood there only like a Chorus who, even when there is nothing for them to do, remain upon the stage in order to strengthen the cast. The General Manager, the same who had so terrified me, reckoned on increasing their number considerably next year, for he had ‘big ideas.’ And this prospect greatly afflicted the manager of the hotel, who found that all these boys about the place only ‘created a nuisance,’ by which he meant that they got in the visitors’ way and were of no use to anyone. But between luncheon and dinner at least, between the exits and entrances of the visitors, they did fill an otherwise empty stage, like those pupils of Mme. de Maintenon who, in the garb of young Israelites, carry on the action whenever Esther or Joad ‘goes off.’ But the outside page, with his delicate tints, his tall, slender, fragile trunk, in proximity to whom I stood waiting for the Marquise to come downstairs, preserved an immobility into which a certain melancholy entered, for his elder brothers had left the hotel for more brilliant careers elsewhere, and he felt keenly his isolation upon this alien soil. At last Mme. de Villeparisis appeared. To stand by her carriage and to help her into it ought perhaps to have been part of the young page’s duties. But he knew on the one hand that a person who brings her own servants to an hotel expects them to wait on her and is not as a rule lavish with her ‘tips,’ and that generally speaking this was true also of the nobility of the old Faubourg Saint-Germain. Mme. de Villeparisis was included in both these categories. The arborescent page concluded therefore that he need expect nothing from her, and leaving her own maid and footman to pack her and her belongings into the carriage, he continued to dream sadly of the enviable lot of his brothers and preserved his vegetable immobility /    We would start off; some time after rounding the railway station, we came into a country road which soon became as familiar to me as the roads round Combray, from the bend where, like a fish-hook, it was baited with charming orchards, to the turning at which we left it, with tilled fields upon either side. Among these we could see here and there an apple-tree, stripped it was true of its blossom, and bearing no more now than a fringe of pistils, but sufficient even so to enchant me since I could imagine, seeing those inimitable leaves, how their broad expanse, like the ceremonial carpet spread for a wedding that was now over, had been but the other day swept by the white satin train of their blushing flowers /    How often in Paris, during the May of the following year, was I to bring home a branch of apple-blossom from the florist, and to stay all night long before its flowers in which bloomed the same creamy essence that powdered besides and whitened the green unfolding leaves, flowers between whose snowy cups it seemed almost as though it had been the salesman who had, in his generosity towards myself, out of his wealth of invention too and as an effective contrast, added on either side the supplement of a becoming crimson bud: I sat gazing at them, I grouped them in the light of my lamp — for so long that I was often still there when the dawn brought to their whiteness the same flush with which it must at that moment have been tingeing their sisters on the Balbec road — and I sought to carry them back in my imagination to that roadside, to multiply them, to spread them out, so as to fill the frame prepared for them, on the canvas, all ready, of those closes the outline of which I knew by heart, which I so longed to see — which one day I must see again, at the moment when, with the exquisite fervour of genius, spring was covering their canvas with its colours /    Before getting into the carriage I had composed the seascape for which I was going to look out, which I had hoped to see with the ‘sun radiant’ upon it, and which at Balbec I could distinguish only in too fragmentary a form, broken by so many vulgar intromissions that had no place in my dream, bathers, dressing-boxes, pleasure yachts. But when, Mme. de Ville-parisis’s carriage having reached high ground, I caught a glimpse of the sea through the leafy boughs of trees, then no doubt at such a distance those temporal details which had set the sea, as it were, apart from nature and history disappeared, and I could as I looked down towards its waves make myself realise that they were the same which Leconte de Lisle describes for us in his Orestie, where “like a flight of birds of prey, before the dawn of day” the long-haired warriors of heroic Hellas “with oars an hundred thousand sweep the huge resounding deep.” But on the other hand I was no longer near enough to the sea which seemed to me not a living thing now, but fixed; I no longer felt any power beneath its colours, spread like those of a picture among the leaves, through which it appeared as inconsistent as the sky and only of an intenser blue /    Mme. de Villeparisis, seeing that I was fond of churches, promised me that we should visit one one day and another another, and especially the church at Carqueville ‘quite buried in all its old ivy,’ as she said with a wave of the hand which seemed tastefully to be clothing the absent ‘front’ in an invisible and delicate screen of foliage. Mme. de Villeparisis would often, with this little descriptive gesture, find just the right word to define the attraction and the distinctive features of an historic building, always avoiding technical terms, but incapable of concealing her thorough understanding of the things to which she referred. She appeared to seek an excuse for this erudition in the fact that one of her father’s country houses, the one in which she had lived as a girl, was situated in a district in which there were churches similar in style to those round Balbec, so that it would have been unaccountable if she had not acquired a taste for architecture, this house being, incidentally, one of the finest examples of that of the Renaissance. But as it was also a regular museum, as moreover Chopin and Liszt had played there, Lamartine recited poetry, all the most famous artists for fully a century inscribed ‘sentiments,’ scored melodies, made sketches in the family album, Mme. de Villeparisis ascribed, whether from delicacy, good breeding, true modesty or want of intelligence, only this purely material origin to her acquaintance with all the arts, and had come, apparently, to regard painting, music, literature and philosophy as the appanage of a young lady brought up on the most aristocratic lines in an historic building that was catalogued and starred. You would have said, listening to her, that she knew of no pictures that were not heirlooms. She was pleased that my grandmother liked a necklace which she wore, and which fell over her dress. It appeared in the portrait of an ancestress of her own by Titian which had never left the family. So that one could be certain of its being genuine. She would not listen to a word about pictures bought, heaven knew where, by a Croesus, she was convinced before you spoke that they were forgeries, and had so desire to see them. We knew that she herself painted flowers in water-colour, and my grandmother, who had heard these praised, spoke to her of them. Mme. de Villeparisis modestly changed the subject, but without shewing either surprise or pleasure more than would an artist whose reputation was established and to whom compliments meant nothing. She said merely that it was a delightful pastime because, even if the flowers that sprang from the brush were nothing wonderful, at least the work made you live in the company of real flowers, of the beauty of which, especially when you were obliged to study them closely in order to draw them, you could never grow tired. But at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis was giving herself a holiday, so as to spare her eyes /    We were astonished, my grandmother and I, to find how much more ‘Liberal’ she was than even the majority of the middle class. She did not understand how anyone could be scandalised by the expulsion of the Jesuits, saying that it had always been done, even under the Monarchy, in Spain even. She took up the defence of the Republic, and against its anti-clericalism had not more to say than: “I should be equally annoyed whether they prevented me from hearing mass when I wanted to, or forced me to hear it when I didn’t!” and even startled us with such utterances as: “Oh! the aristocracy in these days, what does it amount to?” “To my mind, a man who doesn’t work doesn’t count!”— perhaps only because she felt that they gained point and flavour, became memorable, in fact, on her lips /    When we heard these advanced opinions — though never so far advanced as to amount to Socialism, which Mme. de Villeparisis held in abhorrence — expressed so frequently and with so much frankness precisely by one of those people in consideration of whose intelligence our scrupulous and timid impartiality would refuse to condemn outright the ideas of the Conservatives, we came very near, my grandmother and I, to believing that in the pleasant companion of our drives was to be found the measure and the pattern of truth in all things. We took her word for it when she appreciated her Titians, the colonnade of her country house, the conversational talent of Louis-Philippe. But — like those mines of learning who hold us spellbound when we get them upon Egyptian paintings or Etruscan inscriptions, and yet talk so tediously about modern work that we ask ourselves whether we have not been over-estimating the interest of the sciences in which they are versed since there is not apparent in their treatment of them the mediocrity of mind which they must have brought to those studies just as much as to their fatuous essays on Baudelaire — Mme. de Villeparisis, questioned by me about Chateaubriand, about Balzac, about Victor Hugo, each of whom had in his day been the guest of her parents, and had been seen and spoken to by her, smiled at my reverence, told amusing anecdotes of them, such as she had a moment ago been telling us of dukes and statesmen, and severely criticised those writers simply because they had been lacking in that modesty, that self-effacement, that sober art which is satisfied with a single right line, and lays no stress on it, which avoids more than anything else the absurdity of grandiloquence, in that opportuneness, those qualities of moderation, of judgment and simplicity to which she had been taught that real greatness aspired and attained: it was evident that she had no hesitation in placing above them men who might after all, perhaps, by virtue of those qualities, have had the advantage of a Balzac, a Hugo, a Vigny in a drawing-room, an academy, a cabinet council, men like Mole, Fontanes, Vitroles, Bersot, Pasquier, Lebrun, Salvandy or Daru /     “Like those novels of Stendhal, which you seem to admire. You would have given him a great surprise, I assure you, if you had spoken to him in that tone. My father, who used to meet him at M. Mérimée’s — now he was a man of talent, if you like — often told me that Beyle (that was his real name) was appallingly vulgar, but quite good company at dinner, and never in the least conceited about his books. Why, you can see for yourself how he just shrugged his shoulders at the absurdly extravagant compliments of M. de Balzac. There at least he shewed that he knew how to behave like a gentleman.” She possessed the autographs of all these great men, and seemed, when she put forward the personal relations which her family had had with them, to assume that her judgment of them must be better founded than that of young people who, like myself, had had no opportunity of meeting them. “I’m sure I have a right to speak, for they used to come to my father’s house; and as M. Sainte-Beuve, who was a most intelligent man, used to say, in forming an estimate you must take the word of people who saw them close, and were able to judge more exactly of their real worth.” /    Sometimes as the carriage laboured up a steep road through tilled country, making the fields more real, adding to them a mark of authenticity like the precious flower with which certain of the old masters used to sign their pictures, a few hesitating cornflowers, like the Combray cornflowers, would stream in our wake. Presently the horses outdistanced them, but a little way on we would catch sight of another which while it stayed our coming had pricked up to welcome us amid the grass its azure star; some made so bold as to come and plant themselves by the side of the road, and the impression left in my mind was a nebulous blend of distant memories and of wild flowers grown tame /    We began to go down hill; and then met, climbing on foot, on a bicycle, in a cart or carriage, one of those creatures — flowers of a fine day but unlike the flowers of the field, for each of them secretes something that is not to be found in another, with the result that we can never satisfy upon any of her fellows the desire which she has brought to birth in us — a farm-girl driving her cow or half-lying along a waggon, a shopkeeper’s daughter taking the air, a fashionable young lady erect on the back seat of a landau, facing her parents. Certainly Bloch had been the means of opening a new era and had altered the value of life for me on the day when he had told me that the dreams which I had entertained on my solitary walks along the Méséglise way, when I hoped that some peasant girl might pass whom I could take in my arms, were not a mere fantasy which corresponded to nothing outside myself, but that all the girls one met, whether villagers or ‘young ladies,’ were alike ready and willing to give ear to such prayers. And even if I were fated, now that I was ill and did not go out by myself, never to be able to make love to them, I was happy all the same, like a child born in a prison or a hospital, who, having always supposed that the human organism was capable of digesting only dry bread and ‘physic,’ has learned suddenly that peaches, apricots and grapes are not simply part of the decoration of the country scene but delicious and easily assimilated food. Even if his gaoler or his nurse does not allow him to pluck those tempting fruits, still the world seems to him a better place and existence in it more clement. For a desire seems to us more attractive, we repose on it with more confidence, when we know that outside ourselves there is a reality which conforms to it, even if, for us, it is not to be realised. And we think with more joy of a life in which (on condition that we eliminate for a moment from our mind the tiny obstacle, accidental and special, which prevents us personally from doing so) we can imagine ourself to be assuaging that desire. As to the pretty girls who went past, from the day on which I had first known that their cheeks could be kissed, I had become curious about their souls. And the universe had appeared to me more interesting /    Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage moved fast. Scarcely had I time to see the girl who was coming in our direction; and yet — as the beauty of people is not like the beauty of things, as we feel that it is that of an unique creature, endowed with consciousness and free-will — as soon as her individuality, a soul still vague, a will unknown to me, presented a tiny picture of itself, enormously reduced but complete, in the depths of her indifferent eyes, at once, by a mysterious response of the pollen ready in me for the pistils that should receive it, I felt surging through me the embryo, as vague, as minute, of the desire not to let this girl pass without forcing her mind to become conscious of my person, without preventing her desires from wandering to some one else, without coming to fix myself in her dreams and to seize and occupy her heart. Meanwhile our carriage rolled away from her, the pretty girl was already left behind, and as she had — of me — none of those notions which constitute a person in one’s mind, her eyes which had barely seen me had forgotten me already. Was it because I had caught but a fragmentary glimpse of her that I had found her so attractive? It may have been. In the first place, the impossibility of stopping when I came to her, the risk of not meeting her again another day, give at once to such a girl the same charm as a place derives from the illness or poverty that prevents us from visiting it, or the so unadventurous days through which we should otherwise have to live from the battle in which we shall doubtless fall. So that, if there were no such thing as habit, life must appear delightful to those of us who would at every moment be threatened with death — that is to say, to all mankind. Then, if our imagination is set going by the desire for what we may not possess, its flight is not limited by a reality completely perceived, in these casual encounters in which the charms of the passing stranger are generally in direct ratio to the swiftness of our passage. If only night is falling and the carriage is moving fast, whether in town or country, there is not a female torso, mutilated like an antique marble by the speed that tears us away and the dusk that drowns it, but aims at our heart, from every turning in the road, from the lighted interior of every shop, the arrows of Beauty, that Beauty of which we are sometimes tempted to ask ourselves whether it is, in this world, anything more than the complementary part that is added to a fragmentary and fugitive stranger by our imagination over-stimulated by regret /    Had I been free to stop, to get down from the carriage and to speak to the girl whom we were passing, should I perhaps have been disillusioned by some fault in her complexion which from the carriage I had not distinguished? (After which every effort to penetrate into her life would have seemed suddenly impossible. For beauty is a sequence of hypotheses which ugliness cuts short when it bars the way that we could already see opening into the unknown.) Perhaps a single word which she might have uttered, a smile, would have furnished me with a key, a clue that I had not expected, to read the expression of her face, to interpret her bearing, which would at once have ceased to be of any interest. It is possible, for I have never in real life met any girls so desirable as on days when I was with some serious person from whom, despite the — myriad pretexts that I invented, I could not tear myself away: some years after that in which I went for the first time to Balbec, as I was driving through Paris with a friend of my father, and had caught sight of a woman walking quickly along the dark street, I felt that it was unreasonable to forfeit, for a purely conventional scruple, my share of happiness in what may very well be the only life there is, and jumping from the carriage without a word of apology I followed in quest of the stranger; lost her where two streets crossed; caught her up again in a third, and arrived at last, breathless, beneath a street lamp, face to face with old Mme. Verdurin whom I had been carefully avoiding for years, and who, in her delight and surprise, exclaimed: “But how very nice of you to have run all this way just to say how d’ye do to me!” /    That year at Balbec, at the moments of such encounters, I would assure my grandmother and Mme. de Villeparisis that I had so severe a headache that the best thing for me would be to go home alone on foot. But they would never let me get out of the carriage. And I must add that pretty girl (far harder to find again than an historic building, for she was nameless and had the power of locomotion) to the collection of all those whom I promised myself that I would examine more closely at a later date. One of them, however, happened to pass more than once before my eyes in circumstances which allowed me to believe that I should be able to get to know her when I chose. This was a milk-girl who came from a farm with an additional supply of cream for the hotel. I fancied that she had recognised me also; and she did, in fact, look at me with an attentiveness which was perhaps due only to the surprise which my attentiveness caused her. And next day, a day on which I had been resting all morning, when Françoise came in about noon to draw my curtains, she handed me a letter which had been left for me downstairs. I knew no one at Balbec. I had no doubt that the letter was from the milk-girl. Alas, it was only from Bergotte who, as he happened to be passing, had tried to see me, but on hearing that I was asleep had scribbled a few charming lines for which the lift-boy had addressed an envelope which I had supposed to have been written by the milk-girl. I was bitterly disappointed, and the thought that it was more difficult, and more flattering to myself to get a letter from Bergotte did not in the least console me for this particular letter’s not being from her. As for the girl, I never came across her again any more than I came across those whom I had seen only from Mme. de Ville-parisis’s carriage. Seeing and then losing them all thus increased the state of agitation in which I was living, and I found a certain wisdom in the philosophers who recommend us to set a limit to our desires (if, that is, they refer to our desire for people, for that is the only kind that ends in anxiety, having for its object a being at once unknown and unconscious. To suppose that philosophy could refer to the desire for wealth would be too silly.). At the same time I was inclined to regard this wisdom as incomplete, for I said to myself that these encounters made me find even more beautiful a world which thus caused to grow along all the country roads flowers at once rare and common, fleeting treasures of the day, windfalls of the drive, of which the contingent circumstances that would never, perhaps, recur had alone prevented me from taking advantage, and which gave a new zest to life /    But perhaps in hoping that, one day, with greater freedom, I should be able to find on other roads girls much the same, I was already beginning to falsify and corrupt what there is exclusively individual in the desire to live in the company of a woman whom one has found attractive, and by the mere fact that I admitted the possibility of making this desire grow artificially, I had implicitly acknowledged my allusion /    The day on which Mme. de Villeparisis took us to Carqueville, where there was that church, covered in ivy, of which she had spoken to us, a church that, built upon rising ground, dominated both its village and the river that flowed beneath it, and had kept its own little bridge from the middle ages, my grandmother, thinking that I would like to be left alone to study the building at my leisure, suggested to her friend that they should go on and wait for me at the pastry-cook’s, in the village square which was clearly visible from where we were and, in its mellow bloom in the sunshine, seemed like another part of a whole that was all mediaeval. It was arranged that I should join them there later. In the mass of verdure before which I was left standing I was obliged, if I was to discover the church, to make a mental effort which involved my grasping more intensely the idea ‘Church’; in fact, as happens to schoolboys who gather more fully the meaning of a sentence when they are made, by translating or by paraphrasing it, to divest it of the forms to which they are accustomed, this idea of ‘Church,’ which as a rule I scarcely needed when I stood beneath steeples that were recognisable in themselves, I was obliged perpetually to recall so as not to forget, here that the arch in this clump of ivy was that of a pointed window, there that the projection of the leaves was due to the swelling underneath of a capital. Then came a breath of wind, and sent a tremor through the mobile porch, which was overrun by eddies that shot and quivered like a flood of light; the pointed leaves opened one against another; and, shuddering, the arboreal front drew after it green pillars, undulant, caressed and fugitive /    As I came away from the church I saw by the old bridge a cluster of girls from the village who, probably because it was Sunday, were standing about in their best clothes, rallying the young men who went past. Not so well dressed as the others, but seeming to enjoy some ascendancy over them — for she scarcely answered when they spoke to her — with a more serious and a more determined air, there was a tall one who, hoisted upon the parapet of the bridge with her feet hanging down, was holding on her lap a small vessel full of fish which she had presumably just been catching. She had a tanned complexion, gentle eyes but with a look of contempt for her surroundings, a small nose, delicately and attractively modelled. My eyes rested upon her skin; and my lips, had the need arisen, might have believed that they had followed my eyes. But it was not only to her body that I should have liked to attain, there was also her person, which abode within her, and with which there is but one form of contact, namely to attract its attention, but one sort of penetration, to awaken an idea in it /    And this inner self of the charming fisher-girl seemed to be still closed to me, I was doubtful whether I had entered it, even after I had seen my own image furtively reflect itself in the twin mirrors of her gaze, following an index of refraction that was as unknown to me as if I had been placed in the field of vision of a deer. But just as it would not have sufficed that my lips should find pleasure in hers without giving pleasure to them also, so I should have wished that the idea of me which was to enter this creature, was to fasten itself in her, should attract to me not merely her attention but her admiration, her desire, and should compel her to keep me in her memory until the day when I should be able to meet her again. Meanwhile I could see, within a stone’s-throw, the square in which Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage must be waiting for me. I had not a moment to lose; and already I could feel that the girls were beginning to laugh at the sight of me thus held suspended before them. I had a five-franc piece in my pocket. I drew it out, and, before explaining to the girl the errand on which I proposed to send her, so as to have a better chance of her listening to me, I held the coin for a moment before her eyes /     “Since you seem to belong to the place,” I said to her, “I wonder if you would be so good as to take a message for me. I want you to go to a pastrycook’s — which is apparently in a square, but I don’t know where that is — where there is a carriage waiting for me. One moment! To make quite sure, will you ask if the carriage belongs to the Marquise de Villeparisis? But you can’t miss it; it’s a carriage and pair.” /    That was what I wished her to know, so that she should regard me as someone of importance. But when I had uttered the words ‘Marquise’ and ‘carriage and pair,’ suddenly I had a great sense of calm. I felt that the fisher-girl would remember me, and I felt vanishing, with my fear of not being able to meet her again, part also of my desire to meet her. It seemed to me that I had succeeded in touching her person with invisible lips, and that I had pleased her. And this assault and capture of her mind, this immaterial possession had taken from her part of her mystery, just as physical possession does /    We came down towards Hudimesnil; suddenly I was overwhelmed with that profound happiness which I had not often felt since Combray; happiness analogous to that which had been given me by — among other things — the steeples of Martinville. But this time it remained incomplete. I had just seen, standing a little way back from the steep ridge over which we were passing, three trees, probably marking the entrance to a shady avenue, which made a pattern at which I was looking now not for the first time; I could not succeed in reconstructing the place from which they had been, as it were, detached, but I felt that it had been familiar to me once; so that my mind having wavered between some distant year and the present moment, Balbec and its surroundings began to dissolve and I asked myself whether the whole of this drive were not a make-believe, Balbec a place to which I had never gone save in imagination, Mme. de Villeparisis a character in a story and the three old trees the reality which one recaptures on raising one’s eyes from the book which one has been reading and which describes an environment into which one has come to believe that one has been bodily transported /    I looked at the three trees; I could see them plainly, but my mind felt that they were concealing something which it had not grasped, as when things are placed out of our reach, so that our fingers, stretched out at arm’s-length, can only touch for a moment their outer surface, and can take hold of nothing. Then we rest for a little while before thrusting out our arm with refreshed vigour, and trying to reach an inch or two farther. But if my mind was thus to collect itself, to gather strength, I should have to be alone. What would I not have given to be able to escape as I used to do on those walks along the Guermantes way, when I detached myself from my parents! It seemed indeed that I ought to do so now. I recognised that kind of pleasure which requires, it is true, a certain effort on the part of the mind, but in comparison with which the attractions of the inertia which inclines us to renounce that pleasure seem very slight. That pleasure, the object of which I could but dimly feel, that pleasure which I must create for myself, I experienced only on rare occasions, but on each of these it seemed to me that the things which had happened in the interval were of but scant importance, and that in attaching myself to the reality of that pleasure alone I could at length begin to lead a new life. I laid my hand for a moment across my eyes, so as to be able to shut them without Mme. de Villeparisis’s noticing. I sat there, thinking of nothing, then with my thoughts collected, compressed and strengthened I sprang farther forward in the direction of the trees, or rather in that inverse direction at the end of which I could see them growing within myself. I felt again behind them the same object, known to me and yet vague, which I could not bring nearer. And yet all three of them, as the carriage moved on, I could see coming towards me. Where had I looked at them before? There was no place near Combray where an avenue opened off the road like that. The site which they recalled to me, there was no room for it either in the scenery of the place in Germany where I had gone one year with my grandmother to take the waters. Was I to suppose, then, that they came from years already so remote in my life that the landscape which accompanied them had been entirely obliterated from my memory, and that, like the pages which, with sudden emotion, we recognise in a book which we imagined that we had never read, they surged up by themselves out of the forgotten chapter of my earliest infancy? Were they not rather to be numbered among those dream landscapes, always the same, at least for me in whom their unfamiliar aspect was but the objectivation in my dreams of the effort that I had been making while awake either to penetrate the mystery of a place beneath the outward appearance of which I was dimly conscious of there being something more, as had so often happened to me on the Guermantes way, or to succeed in bringing mystery back to a place which I had longed to know and which, from the day on which I had come to know it, had seemed to me to be wholly superficial, like Balbec? Or were they but an image freshly extracted from a dream of the night before, but already so worn, so altered that it seemed to me to come from somewhere far more distant? Or had I indeed never seen them before; did they conceal beneath their surface, like the trees, like the tufts of grass that I had seen beside the Guermantes way, a meaning as obscure, as hard to grasp as is a distant past, so that, whereas they are pleading with me that I would master a new idea, I imagined that I had to identify something in my memory? Or again were they concealing no hidden thought, and was it simply my strained vision that made me see them double in time as one occasionally sees things double in space? I could not tell. And yet all the time they were coming towards me; perhaps some fabulous apparition, a ring of witches or of norns who would propound their oracles to me. I chose rather to believe that they were phantoms of the past, dear companions of my childhood, vanished friends who recalled our common memories. Like ghosts they seemed to be appealing to me to take them with me, to bring them back to life. In their simple, passionate gesticulation I could discern the helpless anguish of a beloved person who has lost the power of speech, and feels that he will never be able to say to us what he wishes to say and we can never guess. Presently, at a cross-roads, the carriage left them. It was bearing me away from what alone I believed to be true, what would have made me truly happy; it was like my life /    I watched the trees gradually withdraw, waving their despairing arms, seeming to say to me: “What you fail to learn from us to-day, you will never know. If you allow us to drop back into the hollow of this road from which we sought to raise ourselves up to you, a whole part of yourself which we were bringing to you will fall for ever into the abyss.” And indeed if, in the course of time, I did discover the kind of pleasure and of disturbance which I had just been feeling once again, and if one evening — too late, but then for all time — I fastened myself to it, of those trees themselves I was never to know what they had been trying to give me nor where else I had seen them. And when, the road having forked and the carriage with it, I turned my back on them and ceased to see them, with Mme. de Villeparisis asking me what I was dreaming about, I was as wretched as though I had just lost a friend, had died myself, had broken faith with the dead or had denied my God /    It was time to be thinking of home. Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a certain feeling for nature, colder than that of my grandmother but capable of recognising, even outside museums and noblemen’s houses, the simple and majestic beauty of certain old and venerable things, told her coachman to take us back by the old Balbec road, a road little used but planted with old elm-trees which we thought quite admirable /    Once we had got to know this road, for a change we would return — that is, if we had not taken it on the outward journey — by another which ran through the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the numberless birds that took up one another’s song close beside us in the trees gave me the same sense of being at rest that one has when one shuts one’s eyes. Chained to my back-seat like Prometheus on his rock I listened to my Oceanides. And when it so happened that I caught a glimpse of one of those birds as it passed from one leaf to another, there was so little apparent connexion between it and the songs that I heard that I could not believe that I was beholding their cause in that little body, fluttering, startled and unseeing /    This road was like many others of the same kind which are to be found in France, climbing on a fairly steep gradient to its summit and then gradually falling for the rest of the way. At the time, I found no great attraction in it, I was only glad to be going home. But it became for me later on a frequent source of joy by remaining in my memory as a lodestone to which all the similar roads that I was to take, on walks or drives or journeys, would at once attach themselves without breach of continuity and would be able, thanks to it, to communicate directly with my heart. For as soon as the carriage or the motor-car turned into one of these roads that seemed to be merely the continuation of the road along which I had driven with Mme. de Villeparisis, the matter to which I found my consciousness directly applying itself, as to the most recent event in my past, would be (all the intervening years being quietly obliterated) the impressions that I had had on those bright summer afternoons and evenings, driving round Balbec, when the leaves smelt good, a mist rose from the ground, and beyond the village close at hand one could see through the trees the sun setting as though it had been merely some place farther along the road, a forest place and distant, which we should not have time to reach that evening. Harmonised with what I was feeling now in another place, on a similar road, surrounded by all the accessory sensations of breathing deep draughts of air, of curiosity, indolence, appetite, lightness of heart which were common to them both, and excluding all others, these impressions would be reinforced, would take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, and almost of a setting of life which, as it happened, I rarely had the luck to-come across, but in which these awakened memories placed, amid the reality that my senses could perceive, no small part of a reality suggested, dreamed, unseizable, to give me, among those regions through which I was passing, more than an aesthetic feeling, a transient but exalted ambition to stay there and to live there always. How often since then, simply because I could smell green leaves, has not being seated on a backseat opposite Mme. de Villeparisis, meeting the Princesse de Luxembourg who waved a greeting to her from her own carriage, coming back to dinner at the Grand Hotel appeared to me as one of those indescribable happinesses which neither the present nor the future can restore to us, which we may taste once only in a lifetime /    Often dusk would have fallen before we reached the hotel. Timidly I would quote to Mme. de Villeparisis, pointing to the moon in the sky, some memorable expression of Chateaubriand or Vigny or Victor Hugo: ‘Shedding abroad that ancient secret of melancholy’ or ‘Weeping like Diana by the brink of her streams’ or ‘The shadows nuptial, solemn and august.’ /     “And so you think that good, do you?” she would ask, “inspired, as you call it. I must confess that I am always surprised to see people taking things seriously nowadays which the friends of those gentlemen, while doing ample justice to their merits, were the first to laugh at. People weren’t so free then with the word ‘inspired’ as they are now, when if you say to a writer that he has mere talent he thinks you’re insulting him. You quote me a fine passage from M. de Chateaubriand about moonlight. You shall see that I have my own reasons for being refractory. M. de Chateaubriand used constantly to come to see my father. He was quite a pleasant person when you were alone with him, because then he was simple and amusing, but the moment he had an audience he would begin to pose, and then he became absurd; when my father was in the room, he pretended that he had flung his resignation in the King’s face, and that he had controlled the voting in the Conclave, forgetting that it was my father whom he had asked to beg the King to take him back, and that my father had heard him make the most idiotic forecasts of the Papal election. You ought to have heard M. de Blacas on that famous Conclave; he was a very different kind of man from M. de Chateaubriand. As to his fine phrases about the moon, they became part of our regular programme for entertaining our guests. Whenever there was any moonlight about the house, if there was anyone staying with us for the first time he would be told to take M. de Chateaubriand for a stroll after dinner. When they came in, my father would take his guest aside and say: ‘Well, and was M. de Chateaubriand very eloquent?’—‘Oh, yes.’ ‘He’s been talking about the moon?’—‘Yes, how did you know?’—‘One moment, didn’t he say ——’ and then my father would quote the passage. ‘He did; but how in the world . . .?’—‘And he spoke to you of the moonlight on the Roman Campagna?’—‘But, my dear sir, you’re a magician.’ My father was no magician, but M. de Chateaubriand had the same little speech about the moon which he served up every time.” /    At the mention of Vigny she laughed: “The man who said: ‘I am the Comte Alfred de Vigny!’ One either is a Comte or one isn’t; it is not of the slightest importance.” And then perhaps she discovered that it was after all, of some slight importance, for she went on: “For one thing I am by no means sure that he was, and in any case he was of the humblest origin, that gentleman who speaks in his verses of his ‘Esquire’s crest.’ In such charming taste, is it not, and so interesting to his readers! Like Musset, a plain Paris cit, who laid so much stress on ‘The golden falcon that surmounts my helm.’ As if you would ever hear a real gentleman say a thing like that! And yet Musset had some talent as a poet. But except Cinq-Mars I have never been able to read a thing by M. de Vigny. I get so bored that the book falls from my hands. M. Mole, who had all the cleverness and tact that were wanting in M. de Vigny, put him properly in his place when he welcomed him to the Academy. Do you mean to say you don’t know the speech? It is a masterpiece of irony and impertinence.” She found fault with Balzac, whom she was surprised to see her nephews admire, for having pretended to describe a society ‘in which he was never received’ and of which his descriptions were wildly improbable. As for Victor Hugo, she told us that M. de Bouillon, her father, who had friends among the young leaders of the Romantic movement, had been taken by some of them to the first performance of Hernani, but that he had been unable to sit through it, so ridiculous had he found the lines of that talented but extravagant writer who had acquired the title of ‘Major Poet’ only by virtue of having struck a bargain, and as a reward for the not disinterested indulgence that he shewed to the dangerous errors of the Socialists /    We had now come in sight of the hotel, with its lights, so hostile that first evening, on our arrival, now protecting and kind, speaking to us of home. And when the carriage drew up outside the door, the porter, the pages, the lift-boy, attentive, clumsy, vaguely uneasy at our lateness, were numbered, now that they had grown familiar, among those beings who change so many times in the course of our life, as we ourself change, but by whom, when they are for the time being the mirror of our habits, we find something attractive in the feeling that we are being faithfully reflected and in a friendly spirit. We prefer them to friends whom we have not seen for some time, for they contain more of what we actually are. Only the outside page, exposed to the sun all day, had been taken indoors for protection from the cold night air and swaddled in thick woollen garments which, combined with the orange effulgence of his locks and the curiously red bloom of his cheeks, made one, seeing him there through the glass front of the hall, think of a hot-house plant muffled up for protection from the frost. We got out of the carriage, with the help of a great many more servants than were required, but they were conscious of the importance of the scene and each felt obliged to take some part in it. I was always very hungry. And so, often, so as not to keep dinner waiting, I would not go upstairs first to the room which had succeeded in becoming so really mine that to catch sight of its long violet curtains and low bookcases was to find myself alone again with that self of which things, like people, gave me a reflected image; but we would all wait together in the hall until the head waiter came to tell us that our dinner was ready. And this gave us another opportunity of listening to Mme. de Villeparisis /     “But you must be tired of us by now,” protested my grandmother /     “Not at all! Why, I am delighted, what could be nicer?” replied her friend with a winning smile, drawing out, almost intoning her words in a way that contrasted markedly with her customary simplicity of speech /    And indeed at such moments as this she was not natural, her mind reverted to her early training, to the aristocratic manner in which a great lady is supposed to shew common people that she is glad to see them, that she is not at all stiff. And her one and only failure in true politeness lay in this excess of politeness; which it was easy to identify as one of the professional ‘wrinkles’ of a lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, who, always seeing in her humbler friends the latent discontent that she must one day arouse in their bosoms, greedily seizes every opportunity en which she can possibly, in the ledger in which she keeps her social account with them, write down a credit balance which will allow her to enter presently on the opposite page the dinner or reception to which she will not invite them. And so, having long ago taken effect in her once and for all, and ignoring the fact that now both the circumstances and the people concerned were different, that in Paris she hoped to see us often come to her house, the spirit of her caste was urging Mme. de Villeparisis on with feverish ardour, and as if the time that was allowed her for being kind to us was limited, to multiply, while we were still at Balbec, her gifts of roses and melons, loans of books, drives in her carriage and verbal effusions. And for that reason, quite as much as the dazzling glories of the beach, the many-coloured flamboyance and subaqueous light of the rooms, as much even as the riding-lessons by which tradesmen’s sons were deified like Alexander of Macedon, the daily kindnesses shewn us by Mme. de Villeparisis and also the unaccustomed, momentary, holiday ease with which my grandmother accepted them have remained in my memory as typical of life at a watering-place /     “Give them your cloaks to take upstairs.” /    My grandmother handed hers to the manager, and because he had been so nice to me I was distressed by this want of consideration, which seemed to pain him /     “I think you’ve hurt his feelings,” said the Marquise. “He probably fancies himself too great a gentleman to carry your wraps. I remember so well the Duc de Nemours, when I was still quite little, coming to see my father who was living then on the top floor of the Bouillon house, with a fat parcel under his arm of letters and newspapers. I can see the Prince now, in his blue coat, framed in our doorway, which had such pretty woodwork round it — I think it was Bagard made it — you know those fine laths that they used to cut, so supple that the joiner would twist them sometimes into little shells and flowers, like the ribbons round a nosegay. ‘Here you are, Cyrus,’ he said to my father, ‘look what your porter’s given me to bring you. He said to me: “Since you’re going up to see the Count, it’s not worth my while climbing all those stairs; but take care you don’t break the string.”’ Now that you have got rid of your things, why don’t you sit down; look, sit in this seat,” she said to my grandmother, taking her by the hand /     “Oh, if you don’t mind, not in that one! There is not room for two, and it’s too big for me by myself; I shouldn’t feel comfortable.” /     “You remind me, for it was exactly like this, of a seat that I had for many years until at last I couldn’t keep it any longer because it had been given to my mother by the poor Duchesse de Praslin. My mother, though she was the simplest person in the world, really, had ideas that belonged to another generation, which even in those days I could scarcely understand; and at first she had not been at all willing to let herself be introduced to Mme. de Praslin, who had been plain Mlle. Sébastian!, while she, because she was a Duchess, felt that it was not for her to be introduced to my mother. And really, you know,” Mme. de Villeparisis went on, forgetting that she herself did not understand these fine shades of distinction, “even if she had just been Mme. de Choiseul, there was a good deal to be said for her claim. The Choiseuls are everything you could want; they spring from a sister of Louis the Fat; they were ruling princes down in Basigny. I admit that we beat them in marriages and in distinction, but the precedence is pretty much the same. This little difficulty gave rise to several amusing incidents, such as a luncheon party which was kept waiting a whole hour or more before one of these ladies could make up her mind to let herself be introduced to the other. In spite of which they became great friends, and she gave my mother a seat like that, in which people always refused to sit, just as you did, until one day my mother heard a carriage drive into the courtyard. She asked a young servant we had, who it was. ‘The Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, ma’am.’ ‘Very well, say that I am at home.’ A quarter of an hour passed; no one came. ‘What about the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld?’ my mother asked. ‘Where is she?’ ‘She’s on the stairs, ma’am, getting her breath,’ said the young servant, who had not been long up from the country, where my mother had the excellent habit of getting all her servants. Often she had seen them born. That’s the only way to get really good ones. And they’re the rarest of luxuries. And sure enough the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld had the greatest difficulty in getting upstairs, for she was an enormous woman, so enormous, indeed, that when she did come into the room my mother was quite at a loss for a moment to know where to put her. And then the seat that Mme. de Praslin had given her caught her eye. ‘Won’t you sit down?’ she said, bringing it forward. And the Duchess filled it from side to side. She was quite a pleasant woman, for all her massiveness. ‘She still creates an effect when she comes in,’ one of our friends said once. ‘She certainly creates an effect when she goes out,’ said my mother, who was rather more free in her speech than would be thought proper nowadays. Even in Mme. de La Rochefoucauld’s own drawing-room people weren’t afraid to make fun of her to her face (at which she was always the first to laugh) over her ample proportions. ‘But are you all alone?’ my grandmother once asked M. de La Rochefoucauld, when she had come to pay a call on the Duchess, and being met at the door by him had not seen his wife who was at the other end of the room. ‘Is Mme. de La Rochefoucauld not at home? I don’t see her.’—‘How charming of you!’ replied the Duke, who had about the worst judgment of any man I have ever known, but was not altogether lacking in humour.” /    After dinner, when I had retired upstairs with my grandmother, I said to her that the qualities which attracted us in Mme. de Villeparisis, her tact, her shrewdness, her discretion, her modesty in not referring to herself, were not, perhaps, of very great value since those who possessed them in the highest degree were simply people like Mole and Loménie, and that if the want of them can make our social relations unpleasant yet it did not prevent from becoming Chateaubriand, Vigny, Hugo, Balzac, a lot of foolish fellows who had no judgment, at whom it was easy to mock, like Bloch. . . . But at the name of Bloch, my grandmother cried out in protest. And she began to praise Mme. de Villeparisis. As we are told that it is the preservation of the species which guides our individual preferences in love, and, so that the child may be constituted in the most normal fashion, sends fat men in pursuit of lean women and vice versa, so in some dim way it was the requirements of my happiness threatened by my disordered nerves, by my morbid tendency to melancholy, to solitude, that made her allot the highest place to the qualities of balance and judgment, peculiar not only to Mme. de Villeparisis but to a society in which our ancestors saw blossom the minds of a Doudan, a M. de Rémusat, not to mention a Beausergent, a Joubert, a Sévigné, a type of mind that invests life with more happiness, with greater dignity than the converse refinements which brought a Baudelaire, a Poe, a Verlaine, a Rimbaud to sufferings, to a disrepute such as my grandmother did not wish for her daughter’s child. I interrupted her with a kiss and asked her if she had noticed some expression which Mme. de Villeparisis had used and which seemed to point to a woman who thought more of her noble birth than she was prepared to admit. In this way I used to submit my impressions of life to my grandmother, for I was never certain what degree of respect was due to anyone until she had informed me. Every evening I would come to her with the mental sketches that I had made during the day of all those non-existent people who were not her. Once I said to her: “I shouldn’t be able to live without you.” “But you mustn’t speak like that;” her voice was troubled. “We must harden our hearts more than that, you know. Or what would become of you if I went away on a journey? But I hope that you would be quite sensible and quite happy.” /     “I could manage to be sensible if you went away for a few days, but I should count the hours.” /     “But if I were to go away for months . . . ” (at the bare suggestion of such a thing my heart was wrung) “ . . . for years . . . for . . . ” /    We both remained silent. We dared not look one another in the face. And yet I was suffering more keenly from her anguish than from my own. And so I walked across to the window, and said to her, with a studied clearness of tone but with averted eyes: /     “You know what a creature of habit I am. For the first few days after I have been parted from the people I love best, I am wretched. But though I go on loving them just as much, I grow used to their absence; life becomes calm, bearable, pleasant; I could stand being parted from them for months, for years . . . ” /    I was obliged to stop, and looked straight out of the window. My grandmother went out of the room for something. But next day I began to talk to her about philosophy, and, speaking in a tone of complete indifference, but at the same time taking care that my grandmother should pay attention to what I was saying, I remarked what a curious thing it was that, according to the latest scientific discoveries, the materialist position appeared to be crumbling, and the most likely thing to be, once again, the survival of the soul and reunion in a life everlasting /    Mme. de Villeparisis gave us warning that presently she would not be able to see so much of us. A young nephew who was preparing for Sau-mur, and was meanwhile stationed in the neighbourhood, at Doncières, was coming to spend a few weeks’ furlough with her, and she would be devoting most of her time to him. In the course of our drives together she had boasted to us of his extreme cleverness, and above all of his goodness of heart; already I was imagining that he would have an instinctive feeling for me, that I was to be his best friend; and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of an appalling woman with whom he was quite infatuated and who would never let him go, since I believed that that sort of love was doomed to end in mental aberration, crime and suicide, thinking how short the time was that was set apart for our friendship, already so great in my heart, although I had not yet set eyes on him, I wept for that friendship and for the misfortunes that were in store for it, as we weep for a person whom we love when some one has just told us that he is seriously ill and that his days are numbered /    One afternoon of scorching heat I was in the dining-room of the hotel, which they had plunged in semi-darkness, to shield it from the glare, by drawing the curtains which the sun gilded, while through the gaps between them I caught flashing blue glimpses of the sea, when along the central gangway leading inland from the beach to the high road I saw, tall, slender, his head held proudly erect upon a springing neck, a young man go past with searching eyes, whose skin was as fair and whose hair as golden as if they had absorbed all the rays of the%un. Dressed in a clinging, almost white material such as I could never have believed that any man would have the audacity to wear, the thinness of which suggested no less vividly than the coolness of the dining-room the heat and brightness of the glorious day outside, he was walking fast. His eyes, from one of which a monocle kept dropping, were of the colour of the sea. Everyone looked at him with interest as he passed, knowing that this young Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray was famed for the smartness of his clothes. All the newspapers had described the suit in which he had recently acted as second to the young Duc d’Uzès in a duel. One felt that this so special quality of his hair, his eyes, his skin, his figure, which would have marked him out in a crowd like a precious vein of opal, azure-shot and luminous, embedded in a mass of coarser substance, must correspond to a life different from that led by other men. So that when, before the attachment which Mme. de Villeparisis had been deploring, the prettiest women in society had disputed the possession of him, his presence, at a watering-place for instance, in the company of the beauty of the season to whom he was paying court, not only made her conspicuous, but attracted every eye fully as much to himself. Because of his ‘tone,’ of his impertinence befitting a young ‘lion,’ and especially of his astonishing good looks, some people even thought him effeminate, though without attaching any stigma, for everyone knew how manly he was and that he was a passionate ‘womaniser.’ This was Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew of whom she had spoken to us. I was overcome with joy at the thought that I was going to know him and to see him for several weeks on end, and confident that he would bestow on me all his affection. He strode rapidly across the hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach, and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall gave him a background against which he was drawn at full length, as in certain portraits whose painters attempt, without in anyway falsifying the most accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their sitter appropriate surroundings, a polo ground, golf links, a racecourse, the bridge of a yacht, to furnish a modern equivalent of those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human figure in the foreground of a landscape. A carriage and pair was waiting for him at the door; and, while his monocle resumed its gambollings in the air of the sunlit street, with the elegance and mastery which a great pianist contrives to display in the simplest piece of execution, where it has not appeared possible that he could shew himself superior to a performer of the second class, Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew, taking the reins that were handed him by the groom, jumped on to the box seat by his side and, while he opened a letter which the manager of the hotel sent out after him, made his horses start /    What a disappointment was mine on the days that followed, when, each time that I met him outside or in the hotel — his head erect, perpetually balancing the movements of his limbs round the fugitive and dancing monocle which seemed to be their centre of gravity — I was forced to admit that he had evidently no desire to make our acquaintance, and saw that he did not bow to us although he must have known that we were friends of his aunt. And calling to mind the friendliness that Mme. de Villeparisis, and before her M. de Norpois, had shewn me, I thought that perhaps they were only of a bogus nobility, and that there might be a secret section in the laws that govern the aristocracy which allowed women, perhaps, and certain diplomats to discard, in their relations with plebeians, for a reason which was beyond me, the stiffness which must, on the other hand, be pitilessly maintained by a young Marquis. My intelligence might have told me the opposite. But the characteristic feature of the silly phase through which I was passing — a phase by no means irresponsive, indeed highly fertile — is that we do not consult our intelligence and that the most trivial attributes of other people seem to us then to form an inseparable part of their personality. In a world thronged with monsters and with gods, we are barely conscious of tranquillity. There is hardly one of the actions which we performed in that phase which we would not give anything, in later life, to be able to erase from our memory. Whereas what we ought to regret is that we no longer possess the spontaneity which made us perform them. In later life we look at things in a more practical way, in full conformity with the rest of society, but youth was the only time in which we learned anything /    This insolence which I surmised in M. de Saint-Loup, and all that it implied of ingrained severity, received confirmation from his attitude whenever he passed us, his body as inflexibly erect, his head always held as high, his gaze as impassive, or rather, I should say, as implacable, devoid of that vague respect which one has for the rights of other people, even if they do not know one’s aunt, one example of which was that I did not look in quite the same way at an old lady as at a gas lamp. These frigid manners were as far removed from the charming letters which, but a few days since, I had still been imagining him as writing to tell me of his regard for myself, as is removed from the enthusiasm of the Chamber and of the populace which he has been picturing himself as rousing by an imperishable speech, the humble, dull, obscure position of the dreamer who, after pondering it thus by himself, for himself, aloud, finds himself, once the imaginary applause has died away, just the same Tom, Dick or Harry as before. When Mme. de Villeparisis, doubtless in an attempt to counteract the bad impression that had been made on us by an exterior indicative of an arrogant and evil nature, spoke to us again of the inexhaustible goodness of her great-nephew (he was the son of one of her nieces, and a little older than myself), I marvelled how the world, with an utter disregard of truth, ascribes tenderness of heart to people whose hearts are in reality so hard and dry, provided only that they behave with common courtesy to the brilliant members of their own sets. Mme. de Villeparisis herself confirmed, though indirectly, my diagnosis, which was already a conviction, of the essential points of her nephew’s character one day when I met them both coming along a path so narrow that there was nothing for it but to introduce me to him. He seemed not to hear that a person’s name was being repeated to him, not a muscle of his face moved; his eyes, in which there shone not the faintest gleam of human sympathy, shewed merely in the insensibility, in the inanity of their gaze an exaggeration failing which there would have been nothing to distinguish them from lifeless mirrors. Then fastening on me those hard eyes, as though he wished to make sure of me before returning my salute, by an abrupt release which seemed to be due rather to a reflex action of his muscles than to an exercise of will, keeping between himself and me the greatest possible interval, he stretched his arm out to its full extension and, at the end of it, offered me his hand. I supposed that it must mean, at the very least, a duel when, next day, he sent me his card. But he spoke to me only of literature, declared after a long talk that he would like immensely to spend several hours with me every day. He had not only, in this encounter, given proof of an ardent zest for the things of the spirit, he had shewn a regard for myself which was little in keeping with his greeting of me the day before. After I had seen him repeat the same process whenever anyone was introduced to him, I realised that it was simply a social usage peculiar to his branch of the family, to which his mother, who had seen to it that he should be perfectly brought up, had moulded his limbs; he went through those motions without thinking, any more than he thought about his beautiful clothes or hair; they were a thing devoid of the moral significance which I had at first ascribed to them, a thing purely acquired like that other habit that he had of at once demanding an introduction to the family of anyone whom he knew, which had become so instinctive in him that, seeing me again the day after our talk, he fell upon me and without asking how I did begged me to make him known to my grandmother, who was with me, with the same feverish haste as if the request had been due to some instinct of self-preservation, like the act of warding off a blow, or of shutting one’s eyes to avoid a stream of boiling water, without which precautions it would have been dangerous to stay where one was a moment longer /    The first rites of exorcism once performed, as a wicked fairy discards her outer form and endures all the most enchanting graces, I saw this disdainful creature become the most friendly, the most considerate young man that I had ever met. “Good,” I said to myself, “I’ve been mistaken about him once already; I was taken in by a mirage; but I have corrected the first only to fall into a second, for he must be a great gentleman who has grown sick of his nobility and is trying to hide it.” As a matter of fact it was not long before all the exquisite breeding, all the friendliness of Saint-Loup were indeed to let me see another creature but one very different from what I had suspected /    This young man who had the air of a scornful, sporting aristocrat had in fact no respect, no interest save for and in the things of the spirit, and especially those modern manifestations of literature and art which seemed so ridiculous to his aunt; he was imbued, moreover, with what she called ‘Socialistic spoutings,’ was filled with the most profound contempt for his caste and spent long hours in the study of Nietzsche and Proudhon. He was one of those intellectuals, quick to admire what is good, who shut themselves up in a book, and are interested only in pure thought. Indeed in Saint-Loup the expression of this highly abstract tendency, which removed him so far from my customary preoccupations, while it seemed to me touching, also annoyed me not a little. I may say that when I realised properly who had been his father, on days when I had been reading memoirs rich in anecdotes of that famous Comte de Marsantes, in whom were embodied the special graces of a generation already remote, the mind full of speculation — anxious to obtain fuller details of the life that M. de Marsantes had led, it used to infuriate me that Robert de Saint-Loup, instead of being content to be the son of his father, instead of being able to guide me through the old-fashioned romance of what had been that father’s existence, had trained himself to enjoy Nietzsche and Proudhon. His father would not have shared my regret. He had been himself a man of brains, who had transcended the narrow confines of his life as a man of the world. He had hardly had time to know his son, but had hoped that his son would prove a better man than himself. And I really believe that, unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired his son, would have rejoiced at his abandoning what had been his own small diversions for austere meditations, and without saying a word, in his modesty as a great gentleman endowed with brains, he would have read in secret his son’s favourite authors in order to appreciate how far Robert was superior to himself /    There was, however, this rather painful consideration: that if M. de Marsantes, with his extremely open mind, would have appreciated a son so different from himself, Robert de Saint-Loup, because he was one of those who believe that merit is attached only to certain forms of art and life, had an affectionate but slightly contemptuous memory of a father who had spent all his time hunting and racing, who yawned at Wagner and raved over Offenbach. Saint-Loup had not the intelligence to see that intellectual worth has nothing to do with adhesion to any one aesthetic formula, and had for the intellectuality of M. de Marsantes much the same sort of scorn as might have been felt for Boieldieu or Labiche by a son of Boieldieu or Labiche who had become adepts in the most symbolic literature and the most complex music. “I scarcely knew my father,” he used to say. “He seems to have been a charming person. His tragedy was the deplorable age in which he lived. To have been born in the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to have to live in the days of La Belle Hélène would be enough to wreck any existence. Perhaps if he’d been some little shopkeeper mad about the Ring he’d have turned out quite different. Indeed they tell me that he was fond of literature. But that can never be proved, because literature to him meant such utterly god-forsaken books.” And in my own case, if I found Saint-Loup a trifle earnest, he could not understand why I was not more earnest still. Never judging anything except by the weight of the intelligence that it contained, never perceiving the magic appeal to the imagination that I found in things which he condemned as frivolous, he was astonished that I— I, to whom he imagined himself to be so utterly inferior — could take any interest in them /    >From the first Saint-Loup made a conquest of my grandmother, not only by the incessant acts of kindness which he went out of his way to shew to us both, but by the naturalness which he put into them as into everything. For naturalness — doubtless because through the artifice of man it allows a feeling of nature to permeate — was the quality which my grandmother preferred to all others, whether in gardens, where she did not like there to be, as there had been in our Combray garden, too formal borders, or at table, where she detested those dressed-up dishes in which you could hardly detect the foodstuffs that had gone to make them, or in piano-playing, which she did not like to be too finicking, too laboured, having indeed had a special weakness for the discords, the wrong notes of Rubinstein. This naturalness she found and enjoyed even in the clothes that Saint-Loup wore, of a pliant elegance, with nothing swagger, nothing formal about them, no stiffness or starch. She appreciated this rich young man still more highly for the free and careless way that he had of living in luxury without ‘smelling of money,’ without giving himself airs; she even discovered the charm of this naturalness in the incapacity which Saint-Loup had kept, though as a rule it is outgrown with childhood, at the same time as certain physiological peculiarities of that period, for preventing his face from at once reflecting every emotion. Something, for instance, that he wanted to have but had not expected, were it no more than a compliment, reacted in him in a burst of pleasure so quick, so burning, so volatile, so expansive that it was impossible for him to contain and to conceal it; a grin of delight seized irresistible hold of his face; the too delicate skin of his cheeks allowed a vivid glow to shine through them, his eyes sparkled with confusion and joy; and my grandmother was infinitely touched by this charming show of innocence and frankness, which, incidentally, in Saint-Loup — at any rate at the period of our first friendship — was not misleading. But I have known another person, and there are many such, in whom the physiological sincerity of that fleeting blush in no way excluded moral duplicity; as often as not it proves nothing more than the vivacity with which pleasure is felt — so that it disarms them and they are forced publicly to confess it — by natures capable of the vilest treachery. But where my grandmother did really adore Saint-Loup’s naturalness was in his way of admitting, without any evasion, his affection for me, to give expression to which he found words than which she herself, she told me, could not have thought of any more appropriate, more truly loving, words to which ‘Sévigné and Beausergent’ might have set their signatures. He was not afraid to make fun of my weaknesses — which he had discerned with an acuteness that made her smile — but as she herself would have done, lovingly, at the same time extolling my good qualities with a warmth, an impulsive freedom that shewed no sign of the reserve, the coldness by means of which young men of his age are apt to suppose that they give themselves importance. And he shewed in forestalling every discomfort, however slight, in covering my legs if the day had turned cold without my noticing it, in arranging (without telling me) to stay later with me in the evening if he thought that I was depressed or felt unwell, a vigilance which, from the point of view of my health, for which a more hardening discipline would perhaps have been better, my grandmother found almost excessive, though as a proof of his affection for myself she was deeply touched by it /    It was promptly settled between us that he and I were to be great friends for ever, and he would say ‘our friendship’ as though he were speaking of some important and delightful thing which had an existence independent of ourselves, and which he soon called — not counting his love for his mistress — the great joy of his life. These words made me rather uncomfortable and I was at a loss for an answer, for I did not feel when I was with him and talked to him — and no doubt it would have been the same with everyone else — any of that happiness which it was, on the other hand, possible for me to experience when I was by myself. For alone, at times, I felt surging from the depths of my being one or other of those impressions which gave me a delicious sense of comfort. But as soon as I was with some one else, when I began to talk to a friend, my mind at once ‘turned about,’ it was towards the listener and not myself that it directed its thoughts, and when they followed this outward course they brought me no pleasure. Once I had left Saint-Loup, I managed, with the help of words, to put more or less in order the confused minutes that I had spent with him; I told myself that I had a good friend, that a good friend was a rare thing, and I tasted, when I felt myself surrounded by ‘goods’ that were difficult to acquire, what was precisely the opposite of the pleasure that was natural to me, the opposite of the pleasure of having extracted from myself and brought to light something that was hidden in my inner darkness. If I had spent two or three hours in conversation with Saint-Loup, and he had expressed his admiration of what I had said to him, I felt a sort of remorse, or regret, or weariness at not having been left alone and ready, at last, to begin my work. But I told myself that one is not given intelligence for one’s own benefit only, that the greatest of men have longed for appreciation, that I could not regard as wasted hours in which I had built up an exalted idea of myself in the mind of my friend; I had no difficulty in persuading myself that I ought to be happy in consequence, and I hoped all the more anxiously that this happiness might never be taken from me simply because I had not yet been conscious of it. We fear more than the loss of everything else the disappearance of the ‘goods’ that have remained beyond our reach, because our heart has not taken possession of them. I felt that I was capable of exemplifying the virtues of friendship better than most people (because I should always place the good of my friends before those personal interests to which other people were devoted but which did not count for me), but not of finding happiness in a feeling which, instead of multiplying the differences that there were between my nature and those of other people — as there are among all of us — would cancel them. At the same time my mind was distinguishing in Saint-Loup a personality more collective than his own, that of the ‘noble’; which like an indwelling spirit moved his limbs, ordered his gestures and his actions; then, at such moments, although in his company, I was as much alone as I should have been gazing at a landscape the harmony of which I could understand. He was no more then than an object the properties of which, in my musing contemplations, I sought to explore. The perpetual discovery in him of this pre-existent, this aeonial creature, this aristocrat who was just what Robert aspired not to be, gave me a keen delight, but one that was intellectual and not social. In the moral and physical agility which gave so much grace to his kindnesses, in the ease with which he offered my grandmother his carriage and made her get into it, in the alacrity with which he sprang from the box, when he was afraid that I might be cold, to spread his own cloak over my shoulders, I felt not only the inherited litheness of the mighty hunters who had been for generations the ancestors of this young man who made no pretence save to intellectuality, their scorn of wealth which, subsisting in him side by side with his enjoyment of it simply because it enabled him to entertain his friends more lavishly, made him so carelessly shower his riches at their feet; I felt in him especially the certainty or the illusion in the minds of those great lords of being ‘better than other people,’ thanks to which they had not been able to hand down to Saint-Loup that anxiety to shew that one is ‘just as good that dread of seeming inferior, of which he was indeed wholly unconscious, but which mars with so much ugliness, so much awkwardness, the most sincere overtures of a plebeian. Sometimes I found fault with myself for thus taking pleasure in my friend as in a work of art, that is to say in regarding the play of all the parts of his being as harmoniously ordered by a general idea from which they depended but which he did not know, so that it added nothing to his own good qualities, to that personal value, intellectual and moral, to which he attached so high a price /    And yet that idea was to a certain extent their determining cause. It was because he was a gentleman that that mental activity, those socialist aspirations, which made him seek the company of young students, arrogant and ill-dressed, connoted in him something really pure and disinterested which was not to be found in them. Looking upon himself as the heir of an ignorant and selfish caste, he was sincerely anxious that they should forgive in him that aristocratic origin which they, on the contrary, found irresistibly attractive and on account of which they sought to know him, though with a show of coldness and indeed of insolence towards him. He was thus led to make advances to people from whom my parents, faithful to the sociological theories of Combray, would have been stupefied at his not turning away in disgust. One day when we were sitting on the sands, Saint-Loup and I, we heard issuing from a canvas tent against which we were leaning a torrent of imprecation against the swarm of Israelites that infested Balbec. “You can’t go a yard without meeting them,” said the voice. “I am not in principle irremediably hostile to the Jewish nation, but here there is a plethora of them. You hear nothing but, ‘I thay, Apraham, I’ve chust theen Chacop.’ You would think you were in the Rue d’Abou-kir.” The man who thus inveighed against Israel emerged at last from the tent; we raised our eyes to behold this anti-Semite. It was my old friend Bloch. Saint-Loup at once begged me to remind him that they had met before the Board of Examiners, when Bloch had carried off the prize of honour, and since then at a popular university course /    At the most I may have smiled now and then, to discover in Robert the marks of his Jesuit schooling, in the awkwardness which the fear of hurting people’s feelings at once created in him whenever one of his intellectual friends made a social error, did something silly to which Saint-Loup himself attached no importance but felt that the other would have blushed if anybody had noticed it. And it was Robert who used to blush as though it had been he that was to blame, for instance on the day when Bloch, after promising to come and see him at the hotel, went on: /     “As I cannot endure to be kept waiting among all the false splendour of these great caravanserais, and the Hungarian band would make me ill, you must tell the ‘lighft-boy’ to make them shut up, and to let you know at once.” /    Personally, I was not particularly anxious that Bloch should come to the hotel. He was at Balbec not by himself, unfortunately, but with his sisters, and they in turn had innumerable relatives and friends staying there. Now this Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. Balbec was in this respect like such countries as Russia or Rumania, where the geography books teach us that the Israelite population does not enjoy anything approaching the same esteem and has not reached the same stage of assimilation as, for instance, in Paris. Always together, with no blend of any other element, when the cousins and uncles of Bloch or their coreligionists male or female repaired to the Casino, the ladies to dance, the gentlemen branching off towards the baccarat-tables, they formed a solid troop, homogeneous within itself, and utterly dissimilar to the people who watched them go past and found them there again every year without ever exchanging a word or a sign with them, whether these were on the Cambremers’ list, or the presiding magistrate’s little group, professional or ‘business’ people, or even simple corn-chandlers from Paris, whose daughters, handsome, proud, derisive and French as the statues at Rheims, would not care to mix with that horde of ill-bred tomboys, who carried their zeal for ‘seaside fashions’ so far as to be always apparently on their way home from shrimping or out to dance the tango. As for the men, despite the brilliance of their dinner-jackets and patent-leather shoes, the exaggeration of their type made one think of what people call the ‘intelligent research’ of painters who, having to illustrate the Gospels or the Arabian Nights, consider the country in which the scenes are laid, and give to Saint Peter or to Ali-Baba the identical features of the heaviest ‘punter’ at the Balbec tables. Bloch introduced his sisters, who, though he silenced their chatter with the utmost rudeness, screamed with laughter at the mildest sallies of this brother, their blindly worshipped idol. So that it is probable that this set of people contained, like every other, perhaps more than any other, plenty of attractions, merits and virtues. But in order to experience these, one had first to penetrate its enclosure. Now it was not popular; it could feel this; it saw in its unpopularity the mark of an anti-semitism to which it presented a bold front in a compact and closed phalanx into which, as it happened, no one ever dreamed of trying to make his way /    At his use of the word ‘lighft’ I had all the less reason to be surprised in that, a few days before, Bloch having asked me why I had come to Balbec (although it seemed to him perfectly natural that he himself should be there) and whether it had been “in the hope of making grand friends,” when I had explained to him that this visit was a fulfilment of one of my earliest longings, though one not so deep as my longing to see Venice, he had replied: “Yes, of course, to sip iced drinks with the pretty ladies, while you pretend to be reading the Stones of Venighce, by Lord John Ruskin, a dreary shaver, in fact one of the most garrulous old barbers that you could find.” So that Bloch evidently thought that in England not only were all the inhabitants of the male sex called ‘Lord,’ but the letter ‘i’ was invariably pronounced ‘igh.’ As for Saint-Loup, this mistake in pronunciation seemed to him all the less serious inasmuch as he saw in it pre-eminently a want of those almost ‘society’ notions which my new friend despised as fully as he was versed in them. But the fear lest Bloch, discovering one day that one says ‘Venice’ and that Ruskin was not a lord, should retrospectively imagine that Robert had been laughing at him, made the latter feel as guilty as if he had been found wanting in the indulgence with which, as we have seen, he overflowed, so that the blush which would no doubt one day dye the cheek of Bloch on the discovery of his error, Robert already, by anticipation and reflex action, could feel mounting to his own. For he fully believed that Bloch attached more importance than he to this mistake. Which Bloch proved to be true some time later, when he heard me pronounce the word ‘lift,’ by breaking in with: /     “Oh, you say ‘lift,’ do you?” And then, in a dry and lofty tone: “Not that it is of the slightest importance.” A phrase that is like a reflex action of the body, the same in all men whose self-esteem is great, in the gravest circumstances as well as in the most trivial, betraying there as clearly as on this occasion how important the thing in question seems to him who declares that it is of no importance; a tragic phrase at times, the first to escape (and then how heart-breaking) the lips of every man at all proud from whom we have just taken the last hope to which he still clung by refusing to do him a service. “Oh, well, it’s not of the slightest importance; I shall make some other arrangement:” the other arrangement which it is not of the slightest importance that he should be driven to adopt being often suicide /    Apart from this, Bloch made me the prettiest speeches. He was certainly anxious to be on the best of terms with me. And yet he asked me: “Is it because you’ve taken a fancy to raise yourself to the peerage that you run after de Saint-Loup-en-Bray? You must be going through a fine crisis of snobbery. Tell me, are you a snob? I think so, what?” Not that his desire to be friendly had suddenly changed. But what is called, in not too correct language, ‘ill breeding’ was his defect, and therefore the defect which he was bound to overlook, all the more that by which he did not believe that other people could be shocked. In the human race the frequency of the virtues that are identical in us all is not more wonderful than the multiplicity of the defects that are peculiar to each one of us. Undoubtedly, it is not common sense that is “the commonest thing in the world”; but human kindness. In the most distant, the most desolate ends of the earth, we marvel to see it blossom of its own accord, as in a remote valley a poppy like the poppies in the world beyond, poppies which it has never seen as it has never known aught but the wind that, now and again, stirring the folds of its scarlet cloak, disturbs its solitude. Even if this human kindness, paralysed by self-interest, is not exercised, it exists none the less, and whenever any inconstant egoist does not restrain its action, when, for example, he is reading a novel or a newspaper, it will bud, blossom, grow, even in the heart of him who, cold-blooded in real life, has retained a tender heart, as a lover of fiction, for the weak, the righteous and the persecuted. But the variety of our defects is no less remarkable than the similarity of our virtues. Each of us has his own, so much so that to continue loving him we are obliged not to take them into account but to ignore them and look only to the rest of his character. The most perfect person in the world has a certain defect which shocks us or makes us angry. One man is of rare intelligence, sees everything from an exalted angle, never speaks evil of anyone, but will pocket and forget letters of supreme importance which it was he himself who asked you to let him post for you, and will then miss a vital engagement without offering you any excuse, with a smile, because he prides himself upon never knowing the time. Another is so refined, so gentle, so delicate in his conduct that he never says anything about you before your face except what you are glad to hear; but you feel that he refrains from uttering, that he keeps buried in his heart, where they grow bitter, very different opinions, and the pleasure that he derives from seeing you is so dear to him that he will let you faint with exhaustion sooner than leave you to yourself. A third has more sincerity, but carries it so far that he feels bound to let you know, when you have pleaded the state of your health as an excuse for not having been to see him, that you were seen going to the theatre and were reported to be looking well, or else that he has not been able to profit entirely by the action which you have taken on his behalf, which, by the way, three other of his friends had already offered to take, so that he is only moderately indebted to you. In similar circumstances the previous friend would have pretended not to know that you had gone to the theatre, or that other people could have done him the same service. But this last friend feels himself obliged to repeat or to reveal to somebody the very thing that is most likely to give offence; is delighted with his own frankness and tells you, emphatically: “I am like that.” While others infuriate you by their exaggerated curiosity, or by a want of curiosity so absolute that you can speak to them of the most sensational happenings without their grasping what it is all about; and others again take months to answer you if your letter has been about something that concerns yourself and not them, or else, if they write that they are coming to ask you for something and you dare not leave the house for fear of missing them, do not appear, but leave you in suspense for weeks because, not having received from you the answer which their letter did not in the least ‘expect,’ they have concluded that you must be cross with them. And others, considering their own wishes and not yours, talk to you without letting you get a word in if they are in good spirits and want to see you, however urgent the work you may have in hand, but if they feel exhausted by the weather or out of humour, you cannot get a word out of them, they meet your efforts with an inert languor and no more take the trouble to reply, even in monosyllables, to what you say to them than if they had not heard you. Each of our friends has his defects so markedly that to continue to love him we are obliged to seek consolation for those defects — in the thought of his talent, his goodness, his affection for ourself — or rather to leave them out of account, and for that we need to display all our good will. Unfortunately our obliging obstinacy in refusing to see the defect in our friend is surpassed by the obstinacy with which he persists in that defect, from his own blindness to it or the blindness that he attributes to other people. For he does not notice it himself, or imagines that it is not noticed. Since the risk of giving offence arises principally from the difficulty of appreciating what does and what does not pass unperceived, we ought, at least, from prudence, never to speak of ourselves, because that is a subject on which we may be sure that other people’s views are never in accordance with our own. If we find as many surprises as on visiting a house of plain exterior which inside is full of hidden treasures, torture-chambers, skeletons, when we discover the true lives of other people, the real beneath the apparent universe, we are no less surprised if, in place of the image that we have made of ourself with the help of all the things that people have said to us, we learn from the terms in which they speak of us in our absence what an entirely different image they have been carrying in their own minds of us and of our life. So that whenever we have spoken about ourselves, we may be sure that our inoffensive and prudent words, listened to with apparent politeness and hypocritical approbation, have given rise afterwards to the most exasperated or the most mirthful, but in either case the least favourable, criticism. The least risk that we run is that of irritating people by the disproportion that there is between our idea of ourselves and the words that we use, a disproportion which as a rule makes people’s talk about themselves as ludicrous as the performances of those self-styled music-lovers who when they feel the need to hum a favourite melody compensate for the inadequacy of their inarticulate murmurings by a strenuous mimicry and a look of admiration which is hardly justified by all that they let us hear. And to the bad habit of speaking about oneself and one’s defects there must be added, as part of the same thing, that habit of denouncing in other people defects precisely analogous to one’s own. For it is always of those defects that people speak, as though it were a way of speaking about oneself, indirectly, which added to the pleasure of absolution that of confession. Besides it seems that our attention, always attracted by what is characteristic of ourselves, notices that more than anything else in other people. One short-sighted man says of another: “But he can scarcely open his eyes!”; a consumptive has his doubts as to the pulmonary integrity of the most robust; an unwashed man speaks only of the baths that other people do not take; an evil-smelling man insists that other people smell; a cuckold sees cuckolds everywhere, a light woman light women, a snob snobs. Then, too, every vice, like every profession, requires and trains a special knowledge which we are never loath to display. The invert detects and denounces inverts; the tailor asked out to dine, before he has begun to talk to you, has passed judgment on the cloth of your coat, which his fingers are itching to feel, and if after a few words of conversation you were to ask a dentist what he really thought of you, he would tell you how many of your teeth wanted filling. To him nothing appears more important, nor more absurd to you who have noticed his own. And it is not only when we speak of ourselves that we imagine other people to be blind; we behave as though they were. On every one of us there is a special god in attendance who hides from him or promises him the concealment from other people of his defect, just as he stops the eyes and nostrils of people who do not wash to the streaks of dirt which they carry in their ears and the smell of sweat which emanates from their armpits, and assures them that they can with impunity carry both of these about a world that will notice nothing. And those who wear artificial pearls, or give them as presents, imagine that people will take them to be genuine. Bloch was ill-bred, neurotic, a snob, and, since he belonged to a family of little repute, had to support, as on the floor of ocean, the incalculable pressure that was imposed on him not only by the Christians upon the surface but by all the intervening layers of Jewish castes superior to his own, each of them crushing with its contempt the one that was immediately beneath it. To carve his way through to the open air by raising himself from Jewish family to Jewish family would have taken Bloch many thousands of years. It was better worth his while to seek an outlet in another direction /    When Bloch spoke to me of the crisis of snobbery through which I must be passing, and bade me confess that I was a snob, I might well have replied: “If I were, I should not be going about with you.” I said merely that he was not being very polite. Then he tried to apologise, but in the way that is typical of the ill-bred man who is only too glad to hark back to whatever it was if he can find an opportunity to aggravate his offence. “Forgive me,” he used now to plead, whenever we met, “I have vexed you, tormented you; I have been wantonly mischievous. And yet — man in general and your friend in particular is so singular an animal — you cannot imagine the affection that I, I who tease you so cruelly, have for you. It carries me often, when I think of you, to tears.” And he gave an audible sob /    What astonished me more in Bloch than his bad manners was to find how the quality of his conversation varied. This youth, so hard to please that of authors who were at the height of their fame he would say: “He’s a gloomy idiot; he’s a sheer imbecile,” would every now and then tell, with immense gusto, stories that were simply not funny or would instance as a ‘really remarkable person’ some man who was completely insignificant. This double scale of measuring the wit, the worth, the interest of people continued to puzzle me until I was introduced to M. Bloch, senior /    I had not supposed that we should ever be allowed to know him, for Bloch junior had spoken ill of me to Saint-Loup and of Saint-Loup to me. In particular, he had said to Robert that I was (always) a frightful snob. “Yes, really, he is overjoyed at knowing M. LLLLegrandin.” This trick of isolating a word, was, in Bloch, a sign at once of irony and of learning. Saint-Loup, who had never heard the name of Legrandin, was bewildered. “But who is he?” “Oh, he’s a bit of all right, he is!” Bloch laughed, thrusting his hands into his pockets as though for warmth, convinced that he was at that moment engaged in contemplation of the picturesque aspect of an extraordinary country gentleman compared to whom those of Barbey d’Aurevilly were as nothing. He consoled himself for his inability to portray M. Legrandin by giving him a string of capital L’s, smacking his lips over the name as over a wine from the farthest bin. But these subjective enjoyments remained hidden from other people. If he spoke ill of me to Saint-Loup he made up for it by speaking no less ill of Saint-Loup to me. We had each of us learned these slanders in detail, the next day, not that we repeated them to each other, a thing which would have seemed to us very wrong, but to Bloch appeared so natural and almost inevitable that in his natural anxiety, in the certainty moreover that he would be telling us only what each of us was bound sooner or later to know, he preferred to anticipate the disclosure and, taking Saint-Loup aside, admitted that he had spoken ill of him, on purpose, so that it might be repeated to him, swore to him “by Zeus Kronion, binder of oaths” that he loved him dearly, that he would lay down his life for him; and wiped away a tear. The same day, he contrived to see me alone, made his confession, declared that he had acted in my interest, because he felt that a certain kind of social intercourse was fatal to me and that I was ‘worthy of better things.’ Then, clasping me by the hand, with the sentimentality of a drunkard, albeit his drunkenness was purely nervous: “Believe me,” he said, “and may the black Ker seize me this instant and bear me across the portals of Hades, hateful to men, if yesterday, when I thought of you, of Combray, of my boundless affection for you, of afternoon hours in class which you do not even remember, I did not lie awake weeping all night long. Yes, all night long, I swear it, and alas, I know — for I know the human soul — you will not believe me.” I did indeed ‘not believe’ him, and to his words which, I felt, he was making up on the spur of the moment, and expanding as he went on, his swearing ‘by Ker’ added no great weight, the Hellenic cult being in Bloch purely literary. Besides, whenever he began to grow sentimental and wished his hearer to grow sentimental over a falsehood, he would say: “I swear it,” more for the hysterical satisfaction of lying than to make people think that he was speaking the truth. I did not believe what he was saying, but I bore him no ill-will for that, for I had inherited from my mother and grandmother their incapacity for resentment even of far worse offenders, and their habit of never condemning anyone /    Besides, he was not altogether a bad youth, this Bloch; he could be, and was at times quite charming. And now that the race of Combray, the race from which sprang creatures absolutely unspoiled like my grandmother and mother, seems almost extinct, as I have hardly any choice now save between honest brutes — insensible and loyal, in whom the mere sound of their voices shews at once that they take absolutely no interest in one’s life — and another kind of men who so long as they are with one understand one, cherish one, grow sentimental even to tears, take — their revenge a few hours later by making some cruel joke at one’s expense, but return to one, always just as comprehending, as charming, as closely assimilated, for the moment, to oneself, I think that it is of this latter sort that I prefer if not the moral worth at any rate the society /     “You cannot imagine my grief when I think of you,” Bloch went on. “When you come to think of it, it is a rather Jewish side of my nature,” he added ironically, contracting his pupils as though he had to prepare for the microscope an infinitesimal quantity of ‘Jewish blood,’ and as might (but never would) have said a great French noble who among his ancestors, all Christian, might nevertheless have included Samuel Bernard, or further still, the Blessed Virgin from whom, it is said, the Levy family claim descent, “coming out. I rather like,” he continued, “to find room among my feelings for the share (not that it is more than a very tiny share) which may be ascribed to my Jewish origin.” He made this statement because it seemed to him at once clever and courageous to speak the truth about his race, a truth which at the same time he managed to water down to a remarkable extent, like misers who decide to pay their debts but have not the courage to pay more than half. This kind of deceit which consists in having the boldness to proclaim the truth, but only after mixing with it an ample measure of lies which falsify it, is commoner than people think, and even among those who do not habitually practise it certain crises in life, especially those in which love is at stake, give them an opportunity of taking to it /    All these confidential diatribes by Bloch to Saint-Loup against me and to me against Saint-Loup ended in an invitation to dinner. I am by no means sure that he did not first make an attempt to secure Saint-Loup by himself. It would have been so like Bloch to do so that probably he did; but if so success did not crown his effort, for it was to myself and Saint-Loup that Bloch said one day: “Dear master, and you, O horseman beloved of Ares, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, tamer of horses, since I have encountered you by the shore of Amphitrite, resounding with foam, hard by the tents of the swift-shipped Méniers, will both of you come to dinner any day this week with my illustrious sire, of blameless heart?” He proffered this invitation because he desired to attach himself more closely to Saint-Loup who would, he hoped, secure him the right of entry into aristocratic circles. Formed by me for myself, this ambition would have seemed to Bloch the mark of the most hideous snobbishness, quite in keeping with the opinion that he already held of a whole side of my nature which he did not regard — or at least had not hitherto regarded — as its most important side; but the same ambition in himself seemed to him the proof of a finely developed curiosity in a mind anxious to carry out certain social explorations from which he might perhaps glean some literary benefit. M. Bloch senior, when his son had told him that he was going to bring one of his friends in to dinner, and had in a sarcastic but satisfied tone enunciated the name and title of that friend: “The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,” had been thrown into great commotion. “The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray! I’ll be jiggered!” he had exclaimed, using the oath which was with him the strongest indication of social deference. And he cast at a son capable of having formed such an acquaintance an admiring glance which seemed to say: “Really, it is astounding. Can this prodigy be indeed a child of mine?” which gave my friend as much pleasure as if his monthly allowance had been increased by fifty francs. For Bloch was not in his element at home and felt that his father treated him like a lost sheep because of his lifelong admiration for Leconte de Lisle, Heredia and other ‘Bohemians.’ But to have got to know Saint-Loup-en-Bray, whose father had been chairman of the Suez Canal board (‘I’ll be jiggered!’) was an indisputable ‘score.’ What a pity, indeed, that they had left in Paris, for fear of its being broken on the journey, the stereoscope. Alone among men, M. Bloch senior had the art, or at least the right to exhibit it. He did this, moreover, on rare occasions only, and then to good purpose, on evenings when there was a full-dress affair, with hired waiters. So that from these exhibitions of the stereoscope there emanated, for those who were present, as it were a special distinction, a privileged position, and for the master of the house who gave them a reputation such as talent confers on a man — which could not have been greater had the photographs been taken by M. Bloch himself and the machine his own invention. “You weren’t invited to Solomon’s yesterday?” one of the family would ask another. “No! I was not one of the elect. What was on?” “Oh, a great how-d’ye-do, the stereoscope, the whole box of tricks!” “Indeed! If they had the stereoscope I’m sorry I wasn’t there; they say Solomon is quite amazing when he works it.”—“It can’t be helped;” said M. Bloch now to his son, “it’s a mistake to let him have everything at once; that would leave him nothing to look forward to.” He had actually thought, in his paternal affection and in the hope of touching his son’s heart, of sending for the instrument. But there was not time, or rather they had thought there would not be; for we were obliged to put off the dinner because Saint-Loup could not leave the hotel, where he was waiting for an uncle who was coming to spend a few days with Mme. de Villeparisis. Since — for he was greatly addicted to physical culture, and especially to long walks — it was largely on foot, spending the night in wayside farms, that this uncle was to make the journey from the country house in which he was staying, the precise date of his arrival at Balbec was by no means certain. And Saint-Loup, afraid to stir out of doors, even entrusted me with the duty of taking to Incauville, where the nearest telegraph-office was, the messages that he sent every day to his mistress. The uncle for whom we were waiting was called Palamède, a name that had come down to him from his ancestors, the Princes of Sicily. And later on when I found, as I read history, belonging to this or that Podestà or Prince of the Church, the same Christian name, a fine renaissance medal — some said, a genuine antique — that had always remained in the family, having passed from generation to generation, from the Vatican cabinet to the uncle of my friend, I felt the pleasure that is reserved for those who, unable from lack of means to start a case of medals, or a picture gallery, look out for old names (names of localities, instructive and picturesque as an old map, a bird’s-eye view, a sign-board or a return of customs; baptismal names, in which rings out and is plainly heard, in their fine French endings, the defect of speech, the intonation of a racial vulgarity, the vicious pronunciation by which our ancestors made Latin and Saxon words undergo lasting mutilations which in due course became the august law-givers of our grammar books) and, in short, by drawing upon their collections of ancient and sonorous words, give themselves concerts like the people who acquire viols da gamba and viols d’amour so as to perform the music of days gone by upon old-fashioned instruments. Saint-Loup told me that even in the most exclusive aristocratic society his uncle Palamède had the further distinction of being particularly difficult to approach, contemptuous, double-dyed in his nobility, forming with his brother’s wife and a few other chosen spirits what was known as the Phoenix Club. There even his insolence was so much dreaded that it had happened more than once that people of good position who had been anxious to meet him and had applied to his own brother for an introduction had met with a refusal: “Really, you mustn’t ask me to introduce you to my brother Palamède. My wife and I, we would all of us do our best for you, but it would be no good. Besides, there’s always the danger of his being rude to you, and I shouldn’t like that.” At the Jockey Club he had, with a few of his friends, marked a list of two hundred members whom they would never allow to be introduced to them. And in the Comte de Paris’s circle he was known by the nickname of ‘The Prince’ because of his distinction and his pride /    Saint-Loup told me about his uncle’s early life, now a long time ago. Every day he used to take women to a bachelor establishment which he shared with two of his friends, as good-looking as himself, on account of which they were known as ‘The Three Graces.’ /     “One day, a man who just now is very much in the eye, as Balzac would say, of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but who at a rather awkward period of his early life displayed odd tastes, asked my uncle to let him come to this place. But no sooner had he arrived than it was not to the ladies but to my uncle Palamède that he began to make overtures. My uncle pretended not to understand, made an excuse to send for his two friends; they appeared on the scene, seized the offender, stripped him, thrashed him till he bled, and then with twenty degrees of frost outside kicked him into the street where he was found more dead than alive; so much so that the police started an inquiry which the poor devil had the greatest difficulty in getting them to abandon. My uncle would never go in for such drastic methods now, in fact you can’t conceive the number of men of humble position that he, who is so haughty with people in society, has shewn his affection, taken under his wing, even if he is paid for it with ingratitude. It may be a servant who has looked after him in a hotel, for whom he will find a place in Paris, or a farm-labourer whom he will pay to have taught a trade. That is really the rather nice side of his character, in contrast to his social side.” Saint-Loup indeed belonged to that type of young men of fashion, situated at an altitude at which it has been possible to cultivate such expressions as: “What is really rather nice about him,” “His rather nice side,” precious seeds which produce very rapidly a way of looking at things in which one counts oneself as nothing and the ‘people’ as everything; the exact opposite, in a word, of plebeian pride. “It seems, it is quite impossible to imagine how he set the tone, how he laid down the law for the whole of society when he was a young man. He acted entirely for himself; in any circumstances he did what seemed pleasing to himself, what was most convenient, but at once the snobs would start copying him. If he felt thirsty at the play, and sent out from his box for a drink, the little sitting-rooms behind all the boxes would be filled, a week later, with refreshments. One wet summer, when he had a touch of rheumatism, he ordered an ulster of a loose but warm vicuna wool, which is used only for travelling rugs, and kept the blue and orange stripes shewing. The big tailors at once received orders from all their customers for blue and orange ulsters of rough wool. If he had some reason for wishing to keep every trace of ceremony out of a dinner in a country house where he was spending the day, and to point the distinction had come without evening clothes and sat down to table in the suit he had been wearing that afternoon, it became the fashion, when you were dining in the country, not to dress. If he was eating some special sweet and instead of taking his spoon used a knife, or a special implement of his own invention which he had had made for him by a silversmith, or his fingers, it at once became wrong to eat it in any other way. He wanted once to hear some Beethoven quartets again (for with all his preposterous ideas he is no fool, mind, he has great gifts) and arranged for some musicians to come and play them to him and a few friends once a week. The ultra-fashionable thing that season was to give quite small parties, with chamber music. I should say he’s not done at all badly out of life. With his looks, he must have had any number of women! I can’t tell you exactly whom, for he is very discreet. But I do know that he was thoroughly unfaithful to my poor aunt. Not that that prevented his being always perfectly charming to her, and her adoring him; he was in mourning for her for years. When he is in Paris, he still goes to the cemetery nearly every day.” /    The morning after Robert had told me all these things about his uncle, while he waited for him (and waited, as it happened, in vain), as I was coming by myself past the Casino on my way back to the hotel, I had the sensation of being watched by somebody who was not far off. I turned my head and saw a man of about forty, very tall and rather stout, with a very dark moustache, who, nervously slapping the leg of his trousers with a switch, kept fastened upon me a pair of eyes dilated with observation. Every now and then those eyes were shot through by a look of intense activity such as the sight of a person whom they do not know excites only in men to whom, for whatever reason, it suggests thoughts that would not occur to anyone else — madmen, for instance, or spies. He trained upon me a supreme stare at once bold, prudent, rapid and profound, like a last shot which one fires at an enemy at the moment when one turns to flee, and, after first looking all round him, suddenly adopting an absent and lofty air, by an abrupt revolution of his whole body turned to examine a playbill on the wall in the reading of which he became absorbed, while he hummed a tune and fingered the moss-rose in his buttonhole. He drew from his pocket a note-book in which he appeared to be taking down the title of the performance that was announced, looked two or three times at his watch, pulled down over his eyes a black straw hat the brim of which he extended with his hand held out over it like a visor, as though to see whether some one were at last coming, made the perfunctory gesture of annoyance by which people mean to shew that they have waited long enough, although they never make it when they are really waiting, then pushing back his hat and exposing a scalp cropped close except at the sides where he allowed a pair of waved ‘pigeon’s-wings’ to grow quite long, he emitted the loud panting breath that people give who are not feeling too hot but would like it to be thought that they were. He gave me the impression of a ‘hotel crook’ who had been watching my grandmother and myself for some days, and while he was planning to rob us had just discovered that I had surprised him in the act of spying; to put me off the scent, perhaps he was seeking only, by his new attitude, to express boredom and detachment, but it was with an exaggeration so aggressive that his object appeared to be — at least as much as the dissipating of the suspicions that I must have had of him — to avenge a humiliation which quite unconsciously I must have inflicted on him, to give me the idea not so much that he had not seen me as that I was an object of too little importance to attract his attention. He threw back his shoulders with an air of bravado, bit his lips, pushed up his moustache, and in the lens of his eyes made an adjustment of something that was indifferent, harsh, almost insulting. So effectively that the singularity of his expression made me take him at one moment for a thief and at another for a lunatic. And yet his scrupulously ordered attire was far more sober and far more simple than that of any of the summer visitors I saw at Balbec, and gave a reassurance to my own suit, so often humiliated by the dazzling and commonplace whiteness of their holiday garb. But my grandmother was coming towards me, we took a turn together, and I was waiting for her, an hour later, outside the hotel into which she had gone for a moment, when I saw emerge from it Mme. de Villeparisis with Robert de Saint-Loup and the stranger who had stared at me so intently outside the Casino. Swift as a lightning-flash his look shot through me, just as at the moment when I first noticed him, and returned, as though he had not seen me, to hover, slightly lowered, before his eyes, dulled, like the neutral look which feigns to see nothing without and is incapable of reporting anything to the mind within, the look which expresses merely the satisfaction of feeling round it the eyelids which it cleaves apart with its sanctimonious roundness, the devout, the steeped look that we see on the faces of certain hypocrites, the smug look on those of certain fools. I saw that he had changed his clothes. The suit he was wearing was darker even than the other; and no doubt this was because the true distinction in dress lies nearer to simplicity than the false; but there was something more; when one came near him one felt that if colour was almost entirely absent from these garments it was not because he who had banished it from them was indifferent to it but rather because for some reason he forbade himself the enjoyment of it. And the sobriety which they displayed seemed to be of the kind that comes from obedience to a rule of diet rather than from want of appetite. A dark green thread harmonised, in the stuff of his trousers, with the clock on his socks, with a refinement which betrayed the vivacity of a taste that was everywhere else conquered, to which this single concession had been made out of tolerance for such a weakness, while a spot of red on his necktie was imperceptible, like a liberty which one dares not take /     “How are you? Let me introduce my nephew, the Baron de Guermantes,” Mme. de Villeparisis greeted me, while the stranger without looking at me, muttering a vague “Charmed!” which he followed with a “H’m, h’m, h’m” to give his affability an air of having been forced, and doubling back his little finger, forefinger and thumb, held out to me his middle and ring fingers, the latter bare of any ring, which I clasped through his suede glove; then, without lifting his eyes to my face, he turned towards Mme. de Villeparisis /     “Good gracious; I shall be forgetting my own name next!” she exclaimed. “Here am I calling you Baron de Guermantes. Let me introduce the Baron de Charlus. After all, it’s not a very serious mistake,” she went on, “for you’re a thorough Guermantes whatever else you are.” /    By this time my grandmother had reappeared, and we all set out together. Saint-Loup’s uncle declined to honour me not only with a word, with so much as a look, even, in my direction. If he stared strangers out of countenance (and during this short excursion he two or three times hurled his terrible and searching scrutiny like a sounding lead at insignificant people of obviously humble extraction who happened to pass), to make up for that he never for a moment, if I was to judge by myself, looked at the people whom he did know, just as a detective on special duty might except his personal friends from his professional vigilance. Leaving them — my grandmother, Mme. de Villeparisis and him — to talk to one another, I fell behind with Saint-Loup /     “Tell me, am I right in thinking I heard Mme. de Villeparisis say just now to your uncle that he was a Guermantes?” /     “Of course he is; Palamède de Guermantes.” /     “Not the same Guermantes who have a place near Combray, and claim descent from Geneviève de Brabant?” /     “Most certainly: my uncle, who is the very last word in heraldry and all that sort of thing, would tell you that our ‘cry,’ our war-cry, that is to say, which was changed afterwards to ‘Passavant’ was originally ‘Combraysis,’” he said, smiling so as not to appear to be priding himself on this prerogative of a ‘cry,’ which only the semi-royal houses, the great chiefs of feudal bands enjoyed. “It’s his brother who has the place now.” /    And so she was indeed related, and quite closely, to the Guermantes, this Mme. de Villeparisis who had so long been for me the lady who had given me a duck filled with chocolates, when I was little, more remote then from the Guermantes way than if she had been shut up somewhere on the Méséglise, less brilliant, less highly placed by me than was the Combray optician, and who now suddenly went through one of those fantastic rises in value, parallel to the depreciations, no less unforeseen, of other objects in our possession, which — rise and fall alike — introduce in our youth and in those periods of our life in which a trace of youth persists changes as numerous as the Metamorphoses of Ovid /     “Haven’t they got, down there, the busts of all the old lords of Guermantes?” /     “Yes; and a lovely sight they are!” Saint-Loup was ironical. “Between you and me, I look on all that sort of thing as rather a joke. But they have got at Guermantes, what is a little more interesting, and, that is quite a touching portrait of my aunt by Carrière. It’s as fine as Whistler or Velasquez,” went on Saint-Loup, who in his neophyte zeal was not always very exact about degrees of greatness. “There are also some moving pictures by Gustave Moreau. My aunt is the niece of your friend Mme. de Ville-parisis; she was brought up by her, and married her cousin, who was a nephew, too, of my aunt Villeparisis, the present Duc de Guermantes.” /     “Then who is this uncle?” /     “He bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Properly speaking, when my great-uncle died, my uncle Palamède ought to have taken the title of Prince des Laumes, which his brother used before he became Duc de Guermantes, for in that family they change their names as you’d change your shirt. But my uncle has peculiar ideas about all that sort of thing. And as he feels that people are rather apt to overdo the Italian Prince and Grandee of Spain business nowadays, though he had half-a-dozen titles of ‘Prince’ to choose from, he has remained Baron de Charlus, as a protest, and with an apparent simplicity which really covers a good deal of pride. ‘In these days,’ he says, ‘everybody is Prince something-or-other; one really must have a title that will distinguish one; I shall call myself Prince when I wish to travel incognito.’ According to him there is no older title than the Charlus barony; to prove to you that it is earlier than the Montmorency title, though they used to claim, quite wrongly, to be the premier barons of France when they were only premier in the He de France, where their fief was, my uncle will explain to you for hours on end and enjoy doing it, because, although he’s a most intelligent man, really gifted, he regards that sort of thing as quite a live topic of conversation,” Saint-Loup smiled again. “But as I am not like him, you mustn’t ask me to talk pedigrees; I know nothing more deadly, more perishing; really, life is not long enough.” /    I now recognised in the hard look which had made me turn round that morning outside the Casino the same that I had seen fixed on me at Tan-sonville, at the moment when Mme. Swann called Gilberte away /     “But, I say, all those mistresses that, you told me, your uncle M. de Charlus had had, wasn’t Mme. Swann one of them?” /     “Good lord, no! That is to say, my uncle’s a great friend of Swann, and has always stood up for him. But no one has ever suggested that he was his wife’s lover. You would make a great sensation in Paris society if people thought you believed that.” /    I dared not reply that it would have caused an even greater sensation in Combray society if people had thought that I did not believe it /    My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. No doubt he attached an extreme importance to all questions of birth and social position, and my grandmother had remarked this, but without any trace of that severity which as a rule embodies a secret envy and the annoyance of seeing some one else enjoy an advantage which one would like but cannot oneself possess. As on the other hand my grandmother, content with her lot and never for a moment regretting that she did not move in a more brilliant sphere, employed only her intellect in observing the eccentricities of M. de Charlus, she spoke of Saint-Loup’s uncle with that detached, smiling, almost affectionate kindness with which we reward the object of our disinterested study for the pleasure that it has given us, all the more that this time the object was a person with regard to whom she found that his if not legitimate, at any rate picturesque pretensions shewed him in vivid contrast to the people whom she generally had occasion to see. But it was especially in consideration of his intelligence and sensibility, qualities which it was easy to see that M. de Charlus, unlike so many of the people in society whom Saint-Loup derided, possessed in a marked degree, that my grandmother had so readily forgiven him his aristocratic prejudice. And yet this had not been sacrificed by the uncle, as it was by the nephew, to higher qualities. Rather, M. de Charlus had reconciled it with them. Possessing, by virtue of his descent from the Ducs de Nemours and Princes de Lamballe, documents, furniture, tapestries, portraits painted for his ancestors by Raphael, Velasquez, Boucher, justified in saying that he was visiting a museum and a matchless library when he was merely turning over his family relics at home, he placed in the rank from which his nephew had degraded it the whole heritage of the aristocracy. Perhaps also, being less metaphysical than Saint-Loup, less satisfied with words, more of a realist in his study of men, he did not care to neglect a factor that was essential to his prestige in their eyes and, if it gave certain disinterested pleasures to his imagination, could often be a powerfully effective aid to his utilitarian activities. No agreement can ever be reached between men of his sort and those who obey the ideal within them which urges them to strip themselves bare of such advantages so that they may seek only to realise that ideal, similar in that respect to the painters, the writers who renounce their virtuosity, the artistic peoples who modernise themselves, warrior peoples who take the initiative in a move for universal disarmament, absolute governments which turn democratic and repeal their harsh laws, though as often as not the sequel fails to reward their noble effort; for the men lose their talent, the nations their secular predominance; ‘pacificism’ often multiplies wars and indulgence criminality. If Saint-Loup’s efforts towards sincerity and emancipation were only to be commended as most noble, to judge by their visible result, one could still be thankful that they had failed to bear fruit in M. de Charlus, who had transferred to his own home much of the admirable panelling from the Guermantes house, instead of substituting, like his nephew, a ‘modern style’ of decoration, employing Lebourg or Guillaumin. It was none the less true that M. de Charlus’s ideal was highly artificial, and, if the epithet can be applied to the word ideal, as much social as artistic. In certain women of great beauty and rare culture whose ancestresses, two centuries earlier, had shared in all the glory and grace of the old order, he found a distinction which made him take pleasure only in their society, and no doubt the admiration for them which he had protested was sincere, but countless reminiscences; historical and artistic, called forth by their names, entered into and formed a great part of it, just as suggestions of classical antiquity are one of the reasons for the pleasure which a booklover finds in reading an Ode of Horace that is perhaps inferior to poems of our own day which would leave the same booklover cold. Any of these women by the side of a pretty commoner was for him what are, hanging beside a contemporary canvas representing a procession or a wedding, those old pictures the history of which we know, from the Pope or King who ordered them, through the hands of people whose acquisition of them, by gift, purchase, conquest or inheritance, recalls to us some event or at least some alliance of historic interest, and consequently some knowledge that we ourselves have acquired, gives it a fresh utility, increases our sense of the richness of the possessions of our memory or of our erudition. M. de Charlus might be thankful that a prejudice similar to his own, by preventing these several great ladies from mixing with women whose blood was less pure, presented them for his veneration unspoiled, in their unaltered nobility, like an eighteenth-century house-front supported on its flat columns of pink marble, in which the passage of time has wrought no change /    M. de Charlus praised the true ‘nobility’ of mind and heart which characterised these women, playing upon the word in a double sense by which he himself was taken in, and in which lay the falsehood of this bastard conception, of this medley of aristocracy, generosity and art, but also its seductiveness, dangerous to people like my grandmother, to whom the less refined but more innocent prejudice of a nobleman who cared only about quarterings and took no thought for anything besides would have appeared too silly for words, whereas she was defenceless as soon as a thing presented itself under the externals of a mental superiority, so much so, indeed, that she regarded Princes as enviable above all other men because they were able to have a Labruyère, a Fénelon as their tutors. Outside the Grand Hotel the three Guermantes left us; they were going to luncheon with the Princesse de Luxembourg. While my grandmother was saying good-bye to Mme. de Villcparisis and Saint-Loup to my grandmother, M. de Charlus who, so far, had not uttered a word to me, drew back a little way from the group and, when he reached my side, said: “I shall be taking tea this evening after dinner in my aunt Villeparisis’s room; I hope that you will give me the pleasure of seeing you there, and your grandmother.” With which he rejoined the Marquise /    Although it was Sunday there were no more carriages waiting outside the hotel now than at the beginning of the season. The solicitor’s wife, in particular, had decided that it was not worth the expense of hiring one every time simply because she was not going to the Cambremers’, and contented herself with staying in her room /     “Is Mme. Blandais not well?” her husband was asked. “We haven’t seen her all day.” /     “She has a slight headache; it’s the heat, there’s thunder coming. The least thing upsets her; but I expect you will see her this evening; I’ve told her she ought to come down. It can’t do her any harm.” /    I had supposed that in thus inviting us to take tea with his aunt, whom I never doubted that he would have warned that we were coming, M. de Charlus wished to make amends for the impoliteness which he had shewn me during our walk that morning. But when, on our entering Mme. de Villeparisis’s room, I attempted to greet her nephew, even although I walked right round him, while in shrill accents he was telling a somewhat spiteful story about one of his relatives, I did not succeed in catching his eye; I decided to say “Good evening” to him, and fairly loud, to warn him of my presence; but I realised that he had observed it, for before ever a word had passed my lips, just as I began to bow to him, I saw his two fingers stretched out for me to shake without his having turned to look at me or paused in his story. He had evidently seen me, without letting it appear that he had, and I noticed then that his eyes, which were never fixed on the person to whom he was speaking, strayed perpetually in all directions, like those of certain animals when they are frightened, or those of street hawkers who, while they are bawling their patter and displaying their illicit merchandise, keep a sharp look-out, though without turning their heads, on the different points of the horizon from any of which may appear, suddenly, the police. At the same time I was a little surprised to find that Mme. de Villeparisis, while glad to see us, did not seem to have been expecting us, and I was still more surprised to hear M. de Charlus say to my grandmother: “Ah! that was a capital idea of yours to come and pay us a visit; charming of them, is it not, my dear aunt?” No doubt he had noticed his aunt’s surprise at our entry and thought, as a man accustomed to set the tone, to strike the right note, that it would be enough to transform that surprise into joy were he to shew that he himself felt it, that it was indeed the feeling which our arrival there ought to have prompted. In which he calculated wisely; for Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a high opinion of her nephew and knew how difficult it was to please him, appeared suddenly to have found new attractions in my grandmother and continued to make much of her. But I failed to understand how M. de Charlus could, in the space of a few hours, have forgotten the invitation — so curt but apparently so intentional, so premeditated — which he had addressed to me that same morning, or why he called a ‘capital idea’ on my grandmother’s part an idea that had been entirely his own. With a scruple of accuracy which I retained until I had reached the age at which I realised that it is not by asking him questions that one learns the truth of what another man has had in his mind, and that the risk of a misunderstanding which will probably pass unobserved is less than that which may come from a purblind insistence: “But, sir,” I reminded him, “you remember, surely, that it was you who asked me if we would come in this evening?” Not a sound, not a movement betrayed that M. de Charlus had so much as heard my question. Seeing which I repeated it, like a diplomat, or like young men after a misunderstanding who endeavour, with untiring and unrewarded zeal, to obtain an explanation which their adversary is determined not to give them. Still M. de Charlus answered me not a word. I seemed to see hovering upon his lips the smile of those who from a great height pass judgment on the characters and breeding of their inferiors /    Since he refused to give any explanation, I tried to provide one for myself, but succeeded only in hesitating between several, none of which could be the right one. Perhaps he did not remember, or perhaps it was I who had failed to understand what he had said to me that morning. . . . More probably, in his pride, he did not wish to appear to have sought to attract people whom he despised, and preferred to cast upon them the responsibility for their intrusion. But then, if he despised us, why had he been so anxious that we should come, or rather that my grandmother should come, for of the two of us it was to her alone that he spoke that evening, and never once to me. Talking with the utmost animation to her, as also to Mme. de Villeparisis, hiding, so to speak, behind them, as though he were seated at the back of a theatre-box, he contented himself, turning from them every now and then the exploring gaze of his penetrating eyes, with fastening it on my face, with the same gravity, the same air of preoccupation as if my face had been a manuscript difficult to decipher /    No doubt, if he had not had those eyes, the face of M. de Charlus would have been similar to the faces of many good-looking men. And when Saint-Loup, speaking to me of various other Guermantes, on a later occasion, said: “Gad, they’ve not got that thoroughbred air, of being gentlemen to their finger-tips, that uncle Palamède has!” confirming my suspicion that a thoroughbred air and aristocratic distinction were not anything mysterious and new but consisted in elements which I had recognised without difficulty and without receiving any particular impression from them, I was to feel that another of my illusions had been shattered. But that face, to which a faint layer of powder gave almost the appearance of a face on the stage, in vain might M. de Charlus hermetically seal its expression; his eyes were like two crevices, two loopholes which alone he had failed to stop, and through which, according to where one stood or sat in relation to him, one felt suddenly flash across one the glow of some internal engine which seemed to offer no reassurance even to him who without being altogether master of it must carry it inside him, at an unstable equilibrium and always on the point of explosion; and the circumspect and unceasingly restless expression of those eyes, with all the signs of exhaustion which, extending from them to a pair of dark rings quite low down upon his cheeks, were stamped on his face, however carefully he might compose and regulate it, made one think of some incognito, some disguise assumed by a powerful mam in danger, or merely by a dangerous — but tragic — person. I should have liked to divine what was this secret which other men did not carry in their breasts and which had already made M. de Charlus’s gaze so enigmatic to me when I had seen him that morning outside the Casino. But with what I now knew of his family I could no longer believe that they were the eyes of a thief, nor, after what I had heard of his conversation, could I say that they were those of a madman. If he was cold with me, while making himself agreeable to my grandmother, that arose perhaps not from a personal antipathy for, generally speaking, just as he was kindly disposed towards women, of whose faults he used to speak without, as a rule, any narrowing of the broadest tolerance, so he shewed with regard to men, and especially young men, a hatred so violent as to suggest that of certain extreme misogynists for women. Two or three ‘carpet-knights,’ relatives or intimate friends of Saint-Loup who happened to mention their names, M. de Charlus, with an almost ferocious expression, in sharp contrast to his usual coldness, called: “Little cads!” I gathered that the particular fault which he found in the young men of the period was their extreme effeminacy. “They’re absolute women,” he said with scorn. But what life would not have appeared effeminate beside that which he expected a man to lead, and never found energetic or virile enough? (He himself, when he walked across country, after long hours on the road would plunge his heated body into frozen streams.) He would not even allow a man to wear a single ring. But this profession of virility did not prevent his having also the most delicate sensibilities. When Mme. de Villeparisis asked him to describe to my grandmother some country house in which Mme. de Sévigné had stayed, adding that she could not help feeling that there was something rather ‘literary’ about that lady’s distress at being parted from “that tiresome Mme. de Grignan”: /     “On the contrary,” he retorted, “I can think of nothing more true. Besides, it was a time in which feelings of that sort were thoroughly understood. The inhabitant of Lafontaine’s Monomotapa, running to see his friend who had appeared to him in a dream, and had looked sad, the pigeon finding that the greatest of evils is the absence of the other pigeon, seem to you perhaps, my dear aunt, as exaggerated as Mme. de Sévigné‘s impatience for the moment when she will be alone with her daughter. It is so fine what she says when she leaves her: ‘This parting gives a pain to my soul which I feel like an ache in my body. In absence one is liberal with the hours. One anticipates a time for which one is longing.’” My grandmother was in ecstasies at hearing the Letters thus spoken of, exactly as she would have spoken of them herself. She was astonished that a man could understand them so thoroughly. She found in M. de Charlus a delicacy, a sensibility that were quite feminine. We said to each other afterwards, when we were by ourselves and began to discuss him together, that he must have come under the strong influence of a woman, his mother, or in later life his daughter if he had any children. “A mistress, perhaps,” I thought to myself, remembering the influence that Saint-Loup’s seemed to have had over him, which enabled me to realise the point to which men can be refined by the women with whom they live /     “Once she was with her daughter, ^he had probably nothing to say to her,” put in Mme. de Villeparisis /     “Most certainly she had: if it was only what she calls ‘things so slight that nobody else would notice them but you and me.’ And anyhow she was with her. And Labruyère tells us that that is everything. ‘To be with the people one loves, to speak to them, not to speak to them, it is all the same.’ He is right; that is the only form of happiness,” added M. de Charlus in a mournful voice, “and that happiness — alas, life is so ill arranged that one very rarely tastes it; Mme. de Sévigné was after all less to be pitied than most of us. She spent a great part of her life with the person whom she loved.” /     “You forget that it was not ‘love’ in her case; the person was her daughter.” /     “But what matters in life is not whom or what one loves,” he went on, in a judicial, peremptory, almost a cutting tone; “it is the fact of loving. What Mme. de Sévigné felt for her daughter has a far better claim to rank with the passion that Racine described in Andromaque or Phèdre than the commonplace relations young Sévigné had with his mistresses. It’s the same with a mystic’s love for his God. The hard and fast lines with which we circumscribe love arise solely from our complete ignorance of life.” /     “You think all that of Andromaque and Phèdre, do you?” Saint-Loup asked his uncle in a faintly contemptuous tone. “There is more truth in a single tragedy of Racine than in all the dramatic works of Monsieur Victor Hugo,” replied M. de Charlus. “People really are overwhelming,” Saint-Loup murmured in my ear. “Preferring Racine to Victor, you may say what you like, it’s epoch-making!” He was genuinely distressed by his uncle’s words, but the satisfaction of saying “you may say what you like” and, better still, “epoch-making” consoled him /    In these reflexions upon the sadness of having to live apart from the person whom one loves (which were to lead my grandmother to say to me that Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew understood certain things quite as well as his aunt, but in a different way, and moreover had something about him that set him far above the average clubman) M. de Charlus not only allowed a refinement of feeling to appear such as men rarely shew; his voice itself, like certain contralto voices which have not been properly trained to the right pitch, so that when they sing it sounds like a duet between a young man and a woman, singing alternately, mounted, when he expressed these delicate sentiments, to its higher notes, took on an unexpected sweetness and seemed to be embodying choirs of betrothed maidens, of sisters, who poured out the treasures of their love. But the bevy of young girls, whom M. de Charlus in his horror of every kind of effeminacy would have been so distressed to learn that he gave the impression of sheltering thus within his voice, did not confine themselves to the interpretation, the modulation of scraps of sentiment. Often while M. de Charlus was talking one could hear their laughter, shrill, fresh laughter of school-girls or coquettes quizzing their partners with all the archness of clever tongues and pretty wits /    He told us how a house that had belonged to his family, in which Marie Antoinette had slept, with a park laid out by Lenôtre, was now in the hands of the Israels, the wealthy financiers, who had bought it. “Israel — at least that is the name these people go by, which seems to me a generic, a racial term rather than a proper name. One cannot tell; possibly people of that sort do not have names, and are designated only by the collective title of the tribe to which they belong. It is of no importance! But fancy, after being a home of the Guermantes, to belong to Israels!!!” His voice rose. “It reminds me of a room in the Château of Blois where the caretaker who was shewing me over said: ‘This is where Mary Stuart used to say her prayers; I use it to keep my brooms in.’ Naturally I wish to know nothing more of this house that has let itself be dishonoured, any more than of my cousin Clara de Chimay after she left her husband. But I keep a photograph of the house, when it was still unspoiled, just as I keep one of the Princess before her large eyes had learned to gaze on anyone but my cousin. A photograph acquires something of the dignity which it ordinarily lacks when it ceases to be a reproduction of reality and shews us things that no longer exist. I could give you a copy, since you are interested in that style of architecture,” he said to my grandmother. At that moment, noticing that the embroidered handkerchief which he had in his pocket was shewing some coloured threads, he thrust it sharply down out of sight with the scandalised air of a prudish but far from innocent lady concealing attractions which, by an excess of scrupulosity, she regards as indecent. “Would you believe,” he went on, “that the first thing the creatures did was to destroy Lenôtre’s park, which is as bad as slashing a picture by Poussin? For that alone, these Israels ought to be in prison. It is true,” he added with a smile, after a moment’s silence, “that there are probably plenty of other reasons why they should be there! In any case, you can imagine the effect, with that architecture behind it, of an English garden.” /     “But the house is in the same style as the Petit Trianon,” said Mme. de Villeparisis, “and Marie-Antoinette had an English garden laid out there.” /     “Which, all the same, ruins Gabriel’s front,” replied M. de Charlus. “Obviously, it would be an act of vandalism now to destroy the Hameau. But whatever may be the spirit of the age, I doubt, all the same, whether, in that respect, a whim of Mme. Israel has the same importance as the memory of the Queen.” /    Meanwhile my grandmother had been making signs to me to go up to bed, in spite of the urgent appeals of Saint-Loup who, to my utter confusion, had alluded in front of M. de Charlus to the depression that used often to come upon me at night before I went to sleep, which his uncle must regard as betokening a sad want of virility. I lingered a few moments still, then went upstairs, and was greatly surprised when, a little later, having heard a knock at my bedroom door and asked who was there, I heard the voice of M. de Charlus saying dryly: /     “It is Charlus. May I come in, sir? Sir,” he began again in the same tone as soon as he had shut the door, “my nephew was saying just now that you were apt to be worried at night before going to sleep, and also that you were an admirer of Bergotte’s books. As I had one here in my luggage which you probably do not know, I have brought it to help you to while away these moments in which you are not comfortable.” /    I thanked M. de Charlus with some warmth and told him that, on the contrary, I had been afraid that what Saint-Loup had said to him about my discomfort when night came would have made me appear in his eyes more stupid even than I was /     “No; why?” he answered, in a gentler voice. “You have not, perhaps, any personal merit; so few of us have! But for a time at least you have youth, and that is always a charm. Besides, sir, the greatest folly of all is to laugh at or to condemn in others what one does not happen oneself to feel. I love the night, and you tell me that you are afraid of it. I love the scent of roses, and I have a friend whom it throws into a fever. Do you suppose that I think, for that reason, that he is inferior to me? I try to understand everything and I take care to condemn nothing. After all, you must not be too sorry for yourself; I do not say that these moods of depression are not painful, I know that one can be made to suffer by things which the world would not understand. But at least you have placed your affection wisely, in your grandmother. You see a great deal of her. And besides, that is a legitimate affection, I mean one that is repaid. There are so many of which one cannot say that.” /    He began walking up and down the room, looking at one thing, taking up another. I had the impression that he had something to tell me, and could not find the right words to express it /     “I have another volume of Bergotte here; I will fetch it for you,” he went on, and rang the bell. Presently a page came. “Go and find me your head waiter. He is the only person here who is capable of obeying an order intelligently,” said M. de Charlus stiffly. “Monsieur Aimé, sir?” asked the page. “I cannot tell you his name; yes, I remember now, I did hear him called Aimé. Run along, I am in a hurry.” “He won’t be a minute, sir, I saw him downstairs just now,” said the page, anxious to appear efficient. There was an interval of silence. The page returned. “Sir, M. Aimé has gone to bed. But I can take your message.” “No, you have only to get him out of bed.” “But I can’t do that, sir; he doesn’t sleep here.” “Then you can leave us alone.” “But, sir,” I said when the page had gone, “you are too kind; one volume of Bergotte will be quite enough.” “That is just what I was thinking.” M. de Charlus walked up and down the room. Several minutes passed in this way, then after a prolonged hesitation, and several false starts, he swung sharply round and, his voice once more stinging, flung at me: “Good night, sir!” and left the room. After all the lofty sentiments which I had heard him express that evening, next day, which was the day of his departure, on the beach, before noon, when I was on my way down to bathe, and M. de Charlus had come across to tell me that my grandmother was waiting for me to join her as soon as I left the water, I was greatly surprised to hear him say, pinching my neck as he spoke, with a familiarity and a laugh that were frankly vulgar: /     “But he doesn’t give a damn for his old grandmother, does he, eh? Little rascal!” /     “What, sir! I adore her!” /     “Sir,” he said, stepping back a pace, and with a glacial air, “you are still young; you should profit by your youth to learn two things; first, to refrain from expressing sentiments that are too natural not to be taken for granted; and secondly not to dash into speech to reply to things that are said to you before you have penetrated their meaning. If you had taken this precaution a moment ago you would have saved yourself the appearance of speaking at cross-purposes like a deaf man, thereby adding a second absurdity to that of having anchors embroidered on your bathing-dress. I have lent you a book by Bergotte which I require. See that it is brought to me within the next hour by that head waiter with the silly and inappropriate name, who, I suppose, is not in bed at this time of day. You make me see that I was premature in speaking to you last night of the charms of youth; I should have done you a better service had I pointed out to you its thoughtlessness, its inconsequence, and its want of comprehension. I hope, sir, that this little douche will be no less salutary to you than your bathe. But don’t let me keep you standing: you may catch cold. Good day, sir.” /    No doubt he was sorry afterwards for this speech, for some time later I received — in a morocco binding on the front of which was inlaid a panel of tooled leather representing in demi-relief a spray of forget-me-nots — the book which he had lent me, and I had sent back to him, not by Aimé who was apparently ‘off duty,’ but by the lift-boy /    M. de Charlus having gone, Robert and I were free at last to dine with Bloch. And I realised during this little party that the stories too readily admitted by our friend as funny were favourite stories of M. Bloch senior, and that the son’s ‘really remarkable person’ was always one of his father’s friends whom he had so classified. There are a certain number of people whom we admire in our boyhood, a father with better brains than the rest of the family, a teacher who acquires credit in our eyes from the philosophy he reveals to us, a schoolfellow more advanced than we are (which was what Bloch had been to me), who despises the Musset of the Espoir en Dieu when we still admire it, and when we have reached Le-conte or Claudel will be in ecstasies only over: /                          A Saint-Biaise, à la Zuecca /                           Vous étiez, vous étiez bien aise: / With which he will include: /                           Padoue est un fort bel endroit /                           Où de très grands docteurs en droit /                           Mais j’aime mieux la polenta /                           Passe dans mon domino noir /                           La Toppatelle / And of all the Nuits will remember only: /                           Au Havre, devant l’Atlantique /                           A Venise, à l’affreux Lido /                           Où vient sur l’herbe d’un tombeau /                           Mourir la pâle Adriatique /    So, whenever we confidently admire anyone, we collect from him, we quote with admiration sayings vastly inferior to the sort which, left to our own judgment, we would sternly reject, just as the writer of a novel puts into it, on the pretext that they are true, things which people have actually said, which in the living context are like a dead weight, form the dull part of the work. Saint-Simon’s portraits composed by himself (and very likely without his admiring them himself) are admirable, whereas what he cites as the charming wit of his clever friends is frankly dull where it has not become meaningless. He would have scorned to invent what he reports as so pointed or so coloured when said by Mme. Cornuel or Louis XIV, a point which is to be remarked also in many other writers, and is capable of various interpretations, of which it is enough to note but one for the present: namely, that in the state of mind in which we ‘observe’ we are a long way below the level to which we rise when we create /    There was, then, embedded in my friend Bloch a father Bloch who lagged forty years behind his son, told impossible stories and laughed as loudly at them from the heart of my friend as did’ the separate, visible and authentic father Bloch, since to the laugh which the latter emitted, not without several times repeating the last word so that his public might taste the full flavour of the story, was added the braying laugh with which the son never failed, at table, to greet his father’s anecdotes. Thus it came about that after saying the most intelligent things young Bloch, to indicate the portion that he had inherited from his family, would tell us for the thirtieth time some of the gems which father Bloch brought out only (with his swallow-tail coat) on the solemn occasions on which young Bloch brought someone to the house on whom it was worth while making an impression; one of his masters, a ‘chum’ who had taken all the prizes, or, this evening, Saint-Loup and myself. For instance: “A military critic of great insight, who had brilliantly worked out, supporting them with proofs, the reasons for which, in the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese must inevitably be beaten and the Russians victorious,” or else: “He is an eminent gentleman who passes for a great financier in political circles and for a great politician among financiers.” These stories were interchangeable with one about Baron de Rothschild and one about Sir Rufus Israels, who were brought into the conversation in an equivocal manner which might let it be supposed that M. Bloch knew them personally /    I was myself taken in, and from the way in which M. Bloch spoke of Bergotte I assumed that he too was an old friend. But with him as with all famous people, M. Bloch knew them only ‘without actually knowing them,’ from having seen them at a distance in the theatre or in the street. He imagined, moreover, that his appearance, his name, his personality were not unknown to them, and that when they caught sight of him they had often to repress a stealthy inclination to bow. People in society, because they know men of talent, original characters, and have them to dine in their houses, do not on that account understand them any better. But when one has lived to some extent in society, the silliness of its inhabitants makes one too anxious to live, suppose too high a standard of intelligence in the obscure circles in which people know only ‘without actually knowing.’ I was to discover this when I introduced the topic of Bergotte. M. Bloch was not the only one who was a social success at home. My friend was even more so with his sisters, whom he continually questioned in a hectoring tone, burying his face in his plate, all of which made them laugh until they cried. They had adopted their brother’s language, and spoke it fluently, as if it had been obligatory and the only form of speech that people of intelligence might use. When we arrived, the eldest sister said to one of the younger ones: “Go, tell our sage father and our venerable mother!” “Puppies,” said Bloch, “I present to you the cavalier Saint-Loup, hurler of javelins, who is come for a few days from Doncières to the dwellings of polished stone, fruitful in horses.” And, since he was as vulgar as he was literary, his speech ended as a rule in some pleasantry of a less Homeric kind: “See, draw closer your pepla with fair clasps, what is all that that I see? Does your mother know you’re out?” And the Misses Bloch subsided in a tempest of laughter. I told their brother how much pleasure he had given me by recommending me to read Bergotte, whose books I had loved /    M. Bloch senior, who knew Bergotte only by sight, and Bergotte’s life only from what was common gossip, had a manner quite as indirect of making the acquaintance of his books, by the help of criticisms that were apparently literary. He lived in the world of ‘very nearlies,’ where people salute the empty air and arrive at wrong judgments. Inexactitude, incompetence do not modify their assurance; quite the contrary. It is the propitious miracle of self-esteem that, since few of us are in a position to enjoy the society of distinguished people, or to form intellectual friendships, those to whom they are denied still believe themselves to be the best endowed of men, because the optics of our social perspective make every grade of society seem the best to him who occupies it, and beholds as less favoured than himself, less fortunate and therefore to be pitied, the greater men whom he names and calumniates without knowing, judges and — despises without understanding them. Even in cases where the multiplication of his modest personal advantages by his self-esteem would not suffice to assure a man the dose of happiness, superior to that accorded to others, which is essential to him, envy is always there to make up the balance. It is true that if envy finds expression in scornful phrases, we must translate ‘I have no wish to know him’ by ‘I have no means of knowing him.’ That is the intellectual sense. But the emotional sense is indeed, ‘I have no wish to know him.’ The speaker knows that it is not true, but he does not, all the same, say it simply to deceive; he says it because it is what he feels, and that is sufficient to bridge the gulf between them, that is to say to make him happy /    Self-centredness thus enabling every human being to see the universe spread out in a descending scale beneath himself who is its lord, M. Bloch afforded himself the luxury of being pitiless when in the morning, as he drank his chocolate, seeing Bergotte’s signature at the foot of an article in the newspaper which he had scarcely opened, he disdainfully granted the writer an audience soon cut short, pronounced sentence upon him, and gave himself the comforting pleasure of repeating after every mouthful of the scalding brew: “That fellow Bergotte has become unreadable. My word, what a bore the creature can be. I really must stop my subscription. How involved it all is, bread and butter nonsense!” And he helped himself to another slice /    This illusory importance of M. Bloch senior did, moreover, extend some little way beyond the radius of his own perceptions. In the first place his children regarded him as a superior person. Children have always a tendency either to depreciate or to exalt their parents, and to a good son his father is always the best of fathers, quite apart from any objective reason there may be for admiring him. Now, such reasons were not altogether lacking in the case of M. Bloch, who was an educated man, shrewd, affectionate towards his family. In his most intimate circle they were all the more proud of him because, if, in ‘society,’ people are judged by a standard (which is incidentally absurd) and according to false but fixed rules, by comparison with the aggregate of all the other fashionable people, in the subdivisions of middle-class life, on the other hand, the dinners, the family parties all turn upon certain people who are pronounced good company, amusing, and who in ‘society’ would not survive a second evening. Moreover in such an environment where the artificial values of the aristocracy do not exist, their place is taken by distinctions even more stupid. Thus it was that in his family circle, and even among the remotest branches of the tree, an alleged similarity in his way of wearing his moustache and in the bridge of his nose led to M. Bloch’s being called “the Due d’Aumale’s double.” (In the world of club pages, the one who wears his cap on one side and his jacket tightly buttoned, so as to give himself the appearance, he imagines, of a foreign officer, is he not also a personage of a sort to his comrades?) /    The resemblance was the faintest, but you would have said that it conferred a title. When he was mentioned, it would always be: “Bloch? Which one? The Due d’Aumale?” as people say “Princesse Murât? Which one? The Queen (of Naples)?” And there were certain other minute marks which combined to give him, in the eyes of the cousinhood, an acknowledged claim to distinction. Not going the length of having a carriage of his own, M. Bloch used on special occasions to hire an open victoria with a pair of horses from the Company, and would drive through the Bois de Boulogne, his body sprawling limply from side to side, two fingers pressed to his brow, other two supporting his chin, and if people who did not know him concluded that he was an ‘old nuisance,’ they were all convinced, in the family, that for smartness Uncle Solomon could have taught Gramont-Caderousse a thing or two. He was one of those people who when they die, because for years they have shared a table in a restaurant on the boulevard with its news-editor, are described as “well known Paris figures” in the social column of the Radical. M. Bloch told Saint-Loup and me that Bergotte knew so well why he, M. Bloch, always cut him that as soon as he caught sight of him, at the theatre or in the club, he avoided his eye. Saint-Loup blushed, for it had occurred to him that this club could not be the Jockey, of which his father had been chairman. On the other hand it must be a fairly exclusive club, for M. Bloch had said that Bergotte would never have got into it if he had come up now. So it was not without the fear that he might be ‘underrating his adversary’ that Saint-Loup asked whether the club in question were the Rue Royale, which was considered ‘lowering’ by his own family, and to which he knew that certain Israelites had been admitted. “No,” replied M. Bloch in a tone at once careless, proud and ashamed, “it is a small club, but far more pleasant than a big one, the Ganaches. We’re very strict there, don’t you know.” “Isn’t Sir Rufus Israels the chairman?” Bloch junior asked his father, so as to give him the opportunity for a glorious lie, never suspecting that the financier had not the same eminence in Saint-Loup’s eyes as in his. The fact of the matter was that the Ganaches club boasted not Sir Rufus Israels but one of his staff. But as this man was on the best of terms with his employer, he had at his disposal a stock of the financier’s cards, and would give one to M. Bloch whenever he wished to travel on a line of which Sir Rufus was a director, the result of which was that old Bloch would say: “I’m just going round to the Club to ask Sir Rufus for a line to the Company.” And the card enabled him to dazzle the guards on the trains. The Misses Bloch were more interested in Bergotte and, reverting to him rather than pursue the subject of the Ganaches, the youngest asked her brother, in the most serious tone imaginable, for she believed that there existed in the world, for the designation of men of talent, no other terms than those which he was in the habit of using: “Is he really an amazing good egg, this Bergotte? Is he in the category of the great lads, good eggs like Villiers and Catullus?” “I’ve met him several times at dress rehearsals,” said M. Nissim Bernard. “He is an uncouth creature, a sort of Schlemihl.” There was nothing very serious in this allusion to Chamisso’s story but the epithet ‘Schlemihl’ formed part of that dialect, half-German, half-Jewish, the use of which delighted M. Bloch in the family circle, but struck him as vulgar and out of place before strangers. And so he cast a reproving glance at his uncle. “He has talent,” said Bloch. “Ah!” His sister sighed gravely, as though to imply that in that case there was some excuse for me. “All writers have talent,” said M. Bloch scornfully. “In fact it appears,” went on his son, raising his fork, and screwing up his eyes with an air of impish irony, “that he is going to put up for the Academy.” “Go on. He hasn’t enough to shew them,” replied his father, who seemed not to have for the Academy the same contempt as his son and daughters. “He’s not big enough.” “Besides, the Academy is a salon, and Bergotte has no polish,” declared the uncle (whose heiress Mme. Bloch was), a mild and inoffensive person whose surname, Bernard, might perhaps by itself have quickened my grandfather’s powers of diagnosis, but would have appeared too little in harmony with a face which looked as if it had been brought back from Darius’s palace and restored by Mme. Dieulafoy, had not (chosen by some collector desirous of giving a crowning touch of orientalism to this figure from Susa) his first name, Nissim, stretched out above it the pinions of an androcephalous bull from Khorsabad. But M. Bloch never stopped insulting his uncle, whether it was that he was excited by the unresisting good-humour of his butt, or that the rent of the villa being paid by M. Nissim Bernard, the beneficiary wished to shew that he kept his independence, and, more important still, that he was not seeking by flattery to make sure of the rich inheritance to come. What most hurt the old man was being treated so rudely in front of the manservant. He murmured an unintelligible sentence of which all that could be made out was: “when the meschores are in the room.” ‘Meschores,’ in the Bible, means ‘the servant of God.’ In the family circle the Blochs used the word when they referred to their own servants, and were always exhilarated by it, because their certainty of not being understood either by Christians or by the servants themselves enhanced in M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch their twofold distinction of being ‘masters’ and at the same time ‘Jews.’ But this latter source of satisfaction became a source of displeasure when there was ‘company.’ At such times M. Bloch, hearing his uncle say ‘meschores,’ felt that he was making his oriental side too prominent, just as a light-of-love who has invited some of her sisters to meet her respectable friends is annoyed if they allude to their profession or use words that do not sound quite nice. Therefore, so far from his uncle’s request’s producing any effect on M. Bloch, he, beside himself with rage, could contain himself no longer. He let no opportunity pass of scarifying his wretched uncle. “Of course, when there is a chance of saying anything stupid, one can be quite certain that you won’t miss it. You would be the first to lick his boots if he were in the room!” shouted M. Bloch, while M. Nissim Bernard in sorrow lowered over his plate the ringleted beard of King Sargon. My friend, when he began to grow his beard, which also was blue-black and crimped, became very like his great-uncle /     “What! Are you the son of the Marquis de Marsantes? Why, I knew him very well,” said M. Nissim Bernard to Saint-Loup. I supposed that he meant the word ‘knew’ in the sense in which Bloch’s father had said that he knew Bergotte, namely by sight. But he went on: “Your father was one of my best friends.” Meanwhile Bloch had turned very red, his father was looking intensely cross, the Misses Bloch were choking with suppressed laughter. The fact was that in M. Nissim Bernard the love of ostentation which in M. Bloch and his children was held in cheek, had engendered the habit of perpetual lying. For instance, if he was staying in an hotel, M. Nissim Bernard, as M. Bloch equally might have done, would have his newspapers brought to him always by his valet in the dining-room, in the middle of luncheon, when everybody was there, so that they should see that he travelled with a valet. But to the people with whom he made friends in the hotel the uncle used to say what the nephew would never have said, that he was a Senator. He might know quite well that they would sooner or later discover that the title was usurped; he could not, at the critical moment, resist the temptation to assume it. M. Bloch suffered acutely from his uncle’s lies and from all the embarrassments that they led to. “Don’t pay any attention to him, he talks a great deal of nonsense,” he whispered to Saint-Loup, whose interest was all the more whetted, for he was curious to explore the psychology of liars. “A greater liar even than the Ithacan Odysseus, albeit Athene called him the greatest liar among mortals,” his son completed the indictment. “Well, upon my word!” cried M. Nissim Bernard, “If I’d only known that I was going to sit down to dinner with my old friend’s son! Why, I have a photograph still of your father at home, in Paris, and any number of letters from him. He used always to call me ‘uncle,’ nobody ever knew why. He was a charming man, sparkling. I remember so well a dinner I gave at Nice; there were Sardou, Labiche, Augier,” “Molière, Racine, Corneille,” M. Bloch added with sarcasm, while his son completed the tale of guests with “Plautus, Menander, Kalidasa.” M. Nissim Bernard, cut to the quick, stopped short in his reminiscence, and, ascetically depriving himself of a great pleasure, remained silent until the end of dinner /     “Saint-Loup with helm of bronze,” said Bloch, “have a piece more of this duck with thighs heavy with fat, over which the illustrious sacrificer of birds has spilled numerous libations of red wine.” /    As a rule, after bringing out from his store for the entertainment of a distinguished guest his anecdotes of Sir Rufus Israels and others, M. Bloch, feeling that he had succeeded in touching and melting his son’s heart, would withdraw, so as not to spoil his effect in the eyes of the ‘big pot.’ If, however, there was an absolutely compelling reason, as for instance on the night when his son won his fellowship, M. Bloch would add to the usual string of anecdotes the following ironical reflexion which he ordinarily reserved for his own personal friends, so that young Bloch was extremely proud to see it produced for his: “The Government have acted unpardonably. They have forgotten to consult M. Coquelin! M. Coquelin has let it be known that he is displeased.” (M. Bloch prided himself on being a reactionary, with a contempt for theatrical people.) /    But the Misses Bloch and their brother reddened to the tips of their ears, so much impressed were they when Bloch senior, to shew that he could be regal to the last in his entertainment of his son’s two ‘chums,’ gave the order for champagne to be served, and announced casually that, as a treat for us, he had taken three stalls for the performance which a company from the Opéra-Comique was giving that evening at the Casino. He was sorry that he had not been able to get a box. They had all been taken. However, he had often been in the boxes, and really one saw and heard better down by the orchestra. All very well, only, if the defect of his son, that is to say the defect which his son believed to be invisible to other people, was coarseness, the father’s was avarice. And so it was in a decanter that we were served with, under the name of champagne, a light sparkling wine, while under that of orchestra stalls he had taken three in the pit, which cost half as much, miraculously persuaded by the divine intervention of his defect that neither at table nor in the theatre (where the boxes were all empty) would the defect be noticed. When M. Bloch had let us moisten our lips in the flat glasses which his son dignified with the style and title of ‘craters with deeply hollowed flanks,’ he made us admire a picture to which he was so much attached that he had brought it with him to Balbec. He told us that it was a Rubens. Saint-Loup asked innocently if it was signed. M. Bloch replied, blushing, that he had had the signature cut off to make it fit the frame, but that it made no difference, as he had no intention of selling the picture. Then he hurriedly bade us good-night, in order to bury himself in the Journal Officiel, back numbers of which littered the house, and which, he informed us, he was obliged to read carefully on account of his ‘parliamentary position’ as to the precise nature of which, however, he gave us no enlightenment. “I shall take a muffler,” said Bloch, “for Zephyrus and Boreas are disputing to which of them shall belong the fish-teeming sea, and should we but tarry a little after the show is over, we shall not be home before the first flush of Eos, the rosy-fingered. By the way,” he asked Saint-Loup when we were outside, and I trembled, for I realised at once that it was of M. de Charlus that Bloch was speaking in that tone of irony, “who was that excellent old card dressed in black that I saw you walking with, the day before yesterday, on the beach?” “That was my uncle.” Saint-Loup was ruffled. Unfortunately, a ‘floater’ was far from seeming to Bloch a thing to be avoided. He shook with laughter. “Heartiest congratulations; I ought to have guessed; he has an excellent style, the most priceless dial of an old ‘gaga’ of the highest lineage.” “You are absolutely mistaken; he is an extremely clever man,” retorted Saint-Loup, now furious. “I am sorry about that; it makes him less complete. All the same, I should like very much to know him, for I flatter myself I could write some highly adequate pieces about old buffers like that. Just to see him go by, he’s killing. But I should leave out of account the caricaturable side, which really is hardly worthy of an artist enamoured of the plastic beauty of phrases, of his mug, which (you’ll forgive me) doubled me up for a moment with joyous laughter, and I should bring into prominence the aristocratic side of your uncle, who after all has a distinct bovine effect, and when one has finished laughing does impress one by his great air of style. But,” he went on, addressing myself this time, “there is also a matter of a very different order about which I have been meaning to question you, and every time we are together, some god, blessed denizen of Olympus, makes me completely forget to ask for a piece of information which might before now have been and is sure some day to be of the greatest use to me. Tell me, who was the lovely lady I saw you with in the Jardin d’Acclimatation accompanied by a gentleman whom I seem to know by sight and a little girl with long hair?” It had been quite plain to me at the time that Mme. Swann did not remember Bloch’s name, since she had spoken of him by another, and had described my friend as being on the staff of some Ministry, as to which I had never since then thought of finding out whether he had joined it. But how came it that Bloch, who, according to what she then told me, had got himself introduced to her, was ignorant of her name? I was so much surprised that I stopped for a moment before answering. “Whoever she is,” he went on, “hearty congratulations; you can’t have been bored with her. I picked her up a few days before that on the Zone railway, where, speaking of zones, she was so kind as to undo hers for the benefit of your humble servant; I have never had such a time in my life, and we were just going to make arrangements to meet again when somebody she knew had the bad taste to get in at the last station but one.” My continued silence did not appear to please Bloch. “I was hoping,” he said, “thanks to you, to learn her address, so as to go there several times a week to taste in her arms the delights of Eros, dear to the gods; but I do not insist since you seem pledged to discretion with respect to a professional who gave herself to me three times running, and in the most refined manner, between Paris and the Point-du-Jour. I am bound to see her again, some night.” /    I called upon Bloch after this dinner; he returned my call, but I was out and he was seen asking for me by Françoise, who, as it happened, albeit he had visited us at Combray, had never set eyes on him until then. So that she knew only that one of ‘the gentlemen’ who were friends of mine had looked in to see me, she did not know ‘with what object,’ dressed in a nondescript way, which had not made any particular impression upon her. Now though I knew quite well that certain of Françoise’s social ideas must for ever remain impenetrable by me, ideas based, perhaps, partly upon confusions between words, between names which she had once and for all time mistaken for one another, I could not restrain myself, who had long since abandoned the quest for enlightenment in such cases, from seeking — and seeking, moreover, in vain — to discover what could be the immense significance that the name of Bloch had for Françoise. For no sooner had I mentioned to her that the young man whom she had seen was M. Bloch than she recoiled several paces, so great were her stupor and disappointment. “What! Is that M. Bloch?” she cried, thunderstruck, as if so portentous a personage ought to have been endowed with an appearance which ‘made you know’ as soon as you saw him that you were in the presence of one of the great ones of the earth; and, like some one who has discovered that an historical character is not ‘up to’ the level of his reputation, she repeated in an impressed tone, in which I could detect latent, for future growth, the seeds of a universal scepticism: “What! Is that M. Bloch? Well, really, you would never think it, to look at him.” She seemed also to bear me a grudge, as if I had always ‘overdone’ the praise of Bloch to her. At the same time she was kind enough to add: “Well, he may be M. Bloch, and all that. I’m sure Master can say he’s every bit as good.” /    She had presently, with respect to Saint-Loup, whom she worshipped, a disillusionment of a different kind and of less severity: she discovered that he was a Republican. Now for all that, when speaking, for instance, of the Queen of Portugal, she would say with that disrespect which is, among the people, the supreme form of respect: “Amélie, Philippe’s sister,” Françoise was a Royalist. But when it came to a Marquis; a Marquis who had dazzled her at first sight, and who was for the Republic, seemed no longer real. And she shewed the same ill-humour as if I had given her a box which she had believed to be made of gold, and had thanked me for it effusively, and then a jeweller had revealed to her that it was only plated. She at once withdrew her esteem from Saint-Loup, but soon afterwards restored it to him, having reflected that he could not, being the Marquis de Saint-Loup, be a Republican, that he was just pretending, in his own interest, for with such a Government as we had it might be a great advantage to him. From that moment her coldness towards him, her resentment towards myself ceased. And when she spoke of Saint-Loup she said: “He is a hypocrite,” with a broad and friendly smile which made it clear that she ‘considered’ him again just as much as when she first knew him, and that she had forgiven him /    As a matter of fact, Saint-Loup was absolutely sincere and disinterested, and it was this intense moral purity which, not being able to find entire satisfaction in a selfish sentiment such as love, nor on the other hand meeting in him the impossibility (which existed in me, for instance) of finding its spiritual nourishment elsewhere than in himself, rendered him truly capable (just as I was incapable) of friendship /    Françoise was no less mistaken about Saint-Loup when she complained that he had that sort of air, as if he did not look down upon the people, but that it was all just a pretence, and you had only to see him when he was in a temper with his groom. It had indeed sometimes happened that Robert would scold his groom with a certain amount of brutality, which proved that he had the sense not so much of the difference as of the equality between classes and masses. “But,” he said in answer to my rebuke of his having treated the man rather harshly, “why should I go out of my way to speak politely to him? Isn’t he my equal? Isn’t he just as near to me as any of my uncles and cousins? You seem to think that I ought to treat him with respect, as an inferior. You talk like an aristocrat!” he added scornfully /    And indeed if there was a class to which he shewed himself prejudiced and hostile, it was the aristocracy, so much so that he found it as hard to believe in the superior qualities of a man in society as he found it easy to believe in those of a man of the people. When I mentioned the Princesse de Luxembourg, whom I had met with his aunt: /     “An old trout,” was his comment. “Like all that lot. She’s a sort of cousin of mine, by the way.” /    Having a strong prejudice against the people who frequented it, he went rarely into ‘Society,’ and the contemptuous or hostile attitude which he adopted towards it served to increase, among all his near relatives, the painful impression made by his intimacy with a woman on the stage, a connexion which, they declared, would be his ruin, blaming it specially for having bred in him that spirit of denigration, that bad spirit, and for having led him astray, after which it was only a matter of time before he would have dropped out altogether. And so, many easy-going men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain were without compunction when they spoke of Robert’s mistress. “Those girls do their job,” they would say, “they are as good as anybody else. But that one; no, thank youl We cannot forgive her. She has done too much harm to a fellow we were fond of.” Of course, he was not the first to be caught in that snare. But the others amused themselves like men of the world, continued to think like men of the world about politics, about everything. As for him, his family found him ‘soured.’ They did not bear in mind that, for many young men of fashion who would otherwise remain uncultivated mentally, rough in their friendships, without gentleness or taste — it is very often their mistress who is their real master, and connexions of this sort the only school of morals in which they are initiated into a superior culture, and learn the value of disinterested relations. Even among the lower orders (who, when it comes to coarseness, so often remind us of the world of fashion) the woman, more sensitive, finer, more leisured, is driven by curiosity to adopt certain refinements, respects certain beauties of sentiment and of art which, though she may fail to understand them, she nevertheless places above what has seemed most desirable to the man, above money or position. Now whether the mistress be a young blood’s (such as Saint-Loup) or a young workman’s (electricians, for instance, must now be included in our truest order of Chivalry) her lover has too much admiration and respect for her not to extend them also to what she herself respects and admires; and for him the scale of values is thereby reversed. Her sex alone makes her weak; she suffers from nervous troubles, inexplicable things which in a man, or even in another woman — a woman whose nephew or cousin he was — would bring a smile to the lips of this stalwart young man. But he cannot bear to see her suffer whom he loves. The young nobleman who, like Saint-Loup, has a mistress acquires the habit, when he takes her out to dine, of carrying in his pocket the valerian ‘drops’ which she may need, of ordering the waiter, firmly and with no hint of sarcasm, to see that he shuts the doors quietly and not to put any damp moss on the table, so as to spare his companion those discomforts which himself he has never felt, which compose for him an occult world in whose reality she has taught him to believe, discomforts for which he now feels pity without in the least needing to understand them, for which he will still feel pity when other women than she shall be the sufferers. Saint-Loup’s mistress — as the first monks of the middle ages taught Christendom — had taught him to be kind to animals, for which she had a passion, never moving without her dog, her canaries, her love-birds; Saint-Loup looked after them with motherly devotion and treated as brutes the people who were not good to dumb creatures. On the other hand, an actress, or so-called actress, like this one who was living with him — whether she were intelligent or not, and as to that I had no knowledge — by making him find the society of fashionable women boring, and look upon having to go out to a party as a painful duty, had saved him from snobbishness and cured him of frivolity. If, thanks to her, his social engagements filled a smaller place in the life of her young lover, at the same time, whereas if he had been simply a drawing-room man, vanity or self-interest would have dictated his choice of friends as rudeness would have characterised his treatment of them, his mistress had taught him to bring nobility and refinement into his friendship. With her feminine instinct, with a keener appreciation in men of certain qualities of sensibility which her lover might perhaps, without her guidance, have misunderstood and laughed at, she had always been swift to distinguish from among the rest of Saint-Loup’s friends, the one who had a real affection for him, and to make that one her favourite. She knew how to make him feel grateful to such a friend, shew his gratitude, notice what things gave his friend pleasure and what pain. And presently Saint-Loup, without any more need of her to prompt him, began to think of all these things by himself, and at Balbec, where she was not with him, for me whom she had never seen, whom he had perhaps not yet so much as mentioned in his letters to her, of his own accord would pull up the window of a carriage in which I was sitting, take out of the room the flowers that made me feel unwell, and when he had to say good-bye to several people at once manage to do so before it was actually time for him to go, so as to be left alone and last with me, to make that distinction between them and me, to treat me differently from the rest. His mistress had opened his mind to the invisible, had brought a serious element into his life, delicacy into his heart, but all this escaped his sorrowing family who repeated: “That creature will be the death of him; meanwhile she’s doing what she can to disgrace him.” It is true that he had succeeded in getting out of her all the good that she was capable of doing him; and that she now caused him only incessant suffering, for she had taken an intense dislike to him and tormented him in every possible way. She had begun, one fine day, to look upon him as stupid and absurd because the friends that she had among the younger writers and actors had assured her that he was, and she duly repeated what they had said with that passion, that want of reserve which we shew whenever we receive from without and adopt as our own opinions or customs of which we previously knew nothing. She readily professed, like her actor friends, that between Saint-Loup and herself there was a great gulf fixed, and not to be crossed, because they were of different races, because she was an intellectual and he, whatever he might pretend, the born enemy of the intellect. This view of him seemed to her profound, and she sought confirmation of it in the most insignificant words, the most trivial actions of her lover. But when the same friends had further convinced her that she was destroying, in company so ill-suited to her, the great hopes which she had, they said, aroused in them, that her lover would leave a mark on her, that by living with him she was spoiling her future as an artist; to her contempt for Saint-Loup was added the same hatred that she would have felt for him if he had insisted upon inoculating her with a deadly germ. She saw him as seldom as possible, at the same time postponing the hour of a definite rupture, which seemed to me a highly improbable event. Saint-Loup made such sacrifices for her that unless she was ravishingly beautiful (but he had always refused to shew me her photograph, saying: “For one thing, she’s not a beauty, and besides she always takes badly. These are only some snapshots that I took myself with my kodak; they would give you a wrong idea of her.”) it would surely be difficult for her to find another man who would consent to anything of the sort. I never reflected that a certain obsession to make a name for oneself, even when one has no talent, that the admiration, no more than the privately expressed admiration of people who are imposing on one, can (although it may not perhaps have been the case with Saint-Loup’s mistress) be, even for a little prostitute, motives more determining than the pleasure of making money. Saint-Loup who, without quite understanding what was going on in the mind of his mistress, did not believe her to be completely sincere either in her unfair reproaches or in her promises of undying love, had all the same at certain moments the feeling that she would break with him whenever she could, and accordingly, impelled no doubt by the instinct of self-preservation which was part of his love, a love more clear-sighted, possibly, than Saint-Loup himself, making use, too, of a practical capacity for business which was compatible in him with the loftiest and blindest flights of the heart, had refused to settle upon her any capital, had borrowed an enormous sum so that she should want nothing, but made it over to her only from day to day. And no doubt, assuming that she really thought of leaving him, she was calmly waiting until she had feathered her nest, a process which, with the money given her by Saint-Loup, would not perhaps take very long, but would all the same require a time which must be conceded to prolong the happiness of my new friend — or his misery /    This dramatic period of their connexion, which had now reached its most acute stage, the most cruel for Saint-Loup, for she had forbidden him to remain in Paris, where his presence exasperated her, and had forced him to spend his leave at Balbec, within easy reach of his regiment — had begun one evening at the house of one of Saint-Loup’s aunts, on whom he had prevailed to allow his friend to come there, before a large party, to recite some of the speeches from a symbolical play in which she had once appeared in an ‘advanced’ theatre, and for which she had made him share the admiration that she herself professed /    But when she appeared in the room, with a large lily in her hand, and wearing a costume copied from the Ancilla Domini, which she had persuaded Saint-Loup was an absolute ‘vision of beauty,’ her entrance had been greeted, in that assemblage of clubmen and duchesses, with smiles which the monotonous tone of her chantings, the oddity of certain words and their frequent recurrence had changed into fits of laughter, stifled at first but presently so uncontrollable that the wretched reciter had been unable to go on. Next day Saint-Loup’s aunt had been universally censured for having allowed so grotesque an actress to appear in her drawing-room. A well-known duke made no bones about telling her that she had only herself to blame if she found herself criticised. “Damn it all, people really don’t come to see ‘turns’ like that! If the woman had talent, even; but she has none and never will have any. ‘Pon my soul, Paris is not such a fool as people make out. Society does not consist exclusively of imbeciles. This little lady evidently believed that she was going to take Paris by surprise. But Paris is not so easily surprised as all that, and there are still some things that they can’t make us swallow.” /    As for the actress, she left the house with Saint-Loup, exclaiming: “What do you mean by letting me in for those geese, those uneducated bitches, those dirty corner-boys? I don’t mind telling you, there wasn’t a man in the room who didn’t make eyes at me or squeeze my foot, and it was because I wouldn’t look at them that they were out for revenge.” /    Words which had changed Robert’s antipathy for people in society into a horror that was at once deep and distressing, and was provoked in him most of all by those who least deserved it, devoted kinsmen who, on behalf of the family, had sought to persuade Saint-Loup’s lady to break with him, a move which she represented to him as inspired by their passion for her. Robert, although he had at once ceased to see them, used to imagine when he was parted from his mistress as he was now, that they or others like them were profiting by his absence to return to the charge and had possibly prevailed over her. And when he spoke of the sensualists who were disloyal to their friends, who sought to seduce their friends’ wives, tried to make them come to houses of assignation, his whole face would glow with suffering and hatred /     “I would kill them with less compunction than I would kill a dog, which is at least a well-behaved beast, and loyal and faithful. There are men who deserve the guillotine if you like, far more than poor wretches who have been led into crime by poverty and by the cruelty of the rich.” /    He spent the greater part of his time in sending letters and telegrams to his mistress. Every time that, while still preventing him from returning to Paris, she found an excuse to quarrel with him by post, I read the news at once in his evident discomposure. Inasmuch as his mistress never told him what fault she found with him, suspecting that possibly if she did not tell him it was because she did not know herself, and simply had had enough of him, he would still have liked an explanation and used to write to her: “Tell me what I have done wrong. I am quite ready to acknowledge my faults,” the grief that overpowered him having the effect of persuading him that he had behaved badly /    But she kept him waiting indefinitely for her answers which, when they did come, were meaningless. And so it was almost always with a furrowed brow, and often with empty hands that I would see Saint-Loup returning from the post office, where, alone in all the hotel, he and Françoise went to fetch or to hand in letters, he from a lover’s impatience, she with a servant’s mistrust of others. (His telegrams obliged him to take a much longer journey.) /    When, some days after our dinner with the Blochs, my grandmother told me with a joyful air that Saint-Loup had just been asking her whether, before he left Balbec, she would not like him to take a photograph of her, and when I saw that she had put on her nicest dress on purpose, and was hesitating between several of her best hats, I felt a little annoyed by this childishness, which surprised me coming from her. I even went the length of asking myself whether I had not been mistaken in my grandmother, whether I did not esteem her too highly, whether she was as unconcerned as I had always supposed in the adornment of her person, whether she had not indeed the very weakness that I believed most alien to her temperament, namely coquetry /    Unfortunately, this displeasure that I derived from the prospect of a photographic ‘sitting,’ and more particularly from the satisfaction with which my grandmother appeared to be looking forward to it, I made so apparent that Françoise remarked it and did her best, unintentionally, to increase it by making me a sentimental, gushing speech, by which I refused to appear moved /     “Oh, Master; my poor Madame will be so pleased at having her likeness taken, she is going to wear the hat that her old Françoise has trimmed for her, you must allow her, Master.” /    I acquired the conviction that I was not cruel in laughing at Françoise’s sensibility, by reminding myself that my mother and grandmother, my models in all things, often did the same. But my grandmother, noticing that I seemed cross, said that if this plan of her sitting for her photograph offended me in any way she would give it up. I would not let her; I assured her that I saw no harm in it, and left her to adorn herself, but, thinking that I shewed my penetration and strength of mind, I added a few stinging words of sarcasm, intended to neutralize the pleasure which she seemed to find in being photographed, so that if I was obliged to see my grandmother’s magnificent hat, I succeeded at least in driving from her face that joyful expression which ought to have made me glad; but alas, it too often happens, while the people we love best are still alive, that such expressions appear to us as the exasperating manifestation of some unworthy freak of fancy rather than as the precious form of the happiness which we should dearly like to procure for them. My ill-humour arose more particularly from the fact that, during the last week, my grandmother had appeared to be avoiding me, and I had not been able to have her to myself for a moment, either by night or day. When I came back in the afternoon to be alone with her for a little I was told that she was not in the hotel; or else she would shut herself up with Françoise for endless confabulations which I was not permitted to interrupt. And when, after being out all evening with Saint-Loup, I had been thinking on the way home of the moment at which I should be able to go to my grandmother and to kiss her, in vain might I wait for her to knock on the partition between us the three little taps which would tell me to go in and say good night to her; I heard nothing; at length I would go to bed, a little resentful of her for depriving me, with an indifference so new and strange in her, of a joy on which I had so much counted, I would lie still for a while, my heart throbbing as in my childhood, listening to the wall which remained silent, until I cried myself to sleep","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'N/A', 'Tags': ['Rap']}"

their good looks were sadly changed. / All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation, / From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged; / The negroes more philosophy display'd,— / Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd. / Juan was juvenile, and thus was full, / As most at his age are, of hope and health; / Yet I must own he looked a little dull, / And now and then a tear stole down by stealth; / Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull / His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth, / A mistress, and such comfortable quarters, / To be put up for auction amongst Tartars, / Were things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless, / Upon the whole his carriage was serene: / His figure, and the splendour of his dress, / Of which some gilded remnants still were seen, / Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess / He was above the vulgar by his mien; / And then, though pale, he was so very handsome; / And then—they calculated on his ransom.Like a backgammon board the place was dotted / With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale, / Though rather more irregularly spotted: / Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale. / It chanced amongst the other people lotted, / A man of thirty rather stout and hale, / With resolution in his dark grey eye, / Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy. / He had an English look; that is, was square / In make, of a complexion white and ruddy, / Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair, / And, it might be from thought or toil or study, / An open brow a little mark'd with care: / One arm had on a bandage rather bloody; / And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater / Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator. / But seeing at his elbow a mere lad, / Of a high spirit evidently, though / At present weigh'd down by a doom which had / O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show / A kind of blunt compassion for the sad / Lot of so young a partner in the woe, / Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse / Than any other scrape, a thing of course. / 'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew / Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not, / All ragamuffins differing but in hue, / With whom it is our luck to cast our lot, / The only gentlemen seem I and you; / So let us be acquainted, as we ought: / If I could yield you any consolation, / 'T would give me pleasure.—Pray, what is your nation?' / When Juan answer'd—'Spanish!' he replied, / 'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek; / Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed: / Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak, / But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried; / But never mind,—she 'll turn, perhaps, next week; / She has served me also much the same as you, / Except that I have found it nothing new.' / 'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume, / What brought you here?'—'Oh! nothing very rare— / Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'—'To this doom / But what conducted, if the question's fair, / Is that which I would learn.'—'I served for some / Months with the Russian army here and there, / And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding, / A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.' / 'Have you no friends?'—'I had—but, by God's blessing, / Have not been troubled with them lately. Now / I have answer'd all your questions without pressing, / And you an equal courtesy should show.' / 'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing, / And long besides.'—'Oh! if 't is really so, / You 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue; / A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long. / 'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life, / Although a female moderately fickle, / Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife) / For any length of days in such a pickle. / To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife / As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle: / Men are the sport of circumstances, when / The circumstances seem the sport of men.' / ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom / I mourn, but for the past;—I loved a maid:'- / He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom; / A single tear upon his eyelash staid / A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume, / 'T is not my present lot, as I have said, / Which I deplore so much; for I have borne / Hardships which have the hardiest overworn, / 'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here / He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face. / 'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear / That there had been a lady in the case; / And these are things which ask a tender tear, / Such as I, too, would shed if in your place: / I cried upon my first wife's dying day, / And also when my second ran away: / 'My third-'—'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round; / 'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?' / 'No—only two at present above ground: / Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see / One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!' / 'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she? / She did not run away, too,—did she, sir?' / 'No, faith.'—'What then?'—'I ran away from her.' / 'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,' / Replied the other, 'what can a man do? / There still are many rainbows in your sky, / But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new, / Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high; / But time strips our illusions of their hue, / And one by one in turn, some grand mistake / Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake. / ''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh, / Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through, / This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh, / Or sometimes only wear a week or two;— / Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh; / Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue / The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days, / Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.' / 'All this is very fine, and may be true,' / Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how / It betters present times with me or you.' / 'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow / By setting things in their right point of view, / Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now, / We know what slavery is, and our disasters / May teach us better to behave when masters.' / 'Would we were masters now, if but to try / Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,' / Said Juan,—swallowing a heart-burning sigh: / 'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!' / 'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,' / Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here; / Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us) / 'But after all, what is our present state? / 'T is bad, and may be better—all men's lot: / Most men are slaves, none more so than the great, / To their own whims and passions, and what not; / Society itself, which should create / Kindness, destroys what little we had got: / To feel for none is the true social art / Of the world's stoics—men without a heart.' / Just now a black old neutral personage / Of the third sex stept up, and peering over / The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age, / And capabilities, as to discover / If they were fitted for the purposed cage: / No lady e'er is ogled by a lover, / Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor, / Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor, / As is a slave by his intended bidder. / 'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures; / And all are to be sold, if you consider / Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features / Are bought up, others by a warlike leader, / Some by a place—as tend their years or natures; / The most by ready cash—but all have prices, / From crowns to kicks, according to their vices. / The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care, / Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid / First but for one, and after for the pair; / They haggled, wrangled, swore, too—so they did! / As though they were in a mere Christian fair / Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid; / So that their bargain sounded like a battle / For this superior yoke of human cattle. / At last they settled into simple grumbling, / And pulling out reluctant purses, and / Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling / Some down, and weighing others in their hand, / And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling, / Until the sum was accurately scann'd, / And then the merchant giving change, and signing / Receipts in full, began to think of dining. / I wonder if his appetite was good? / Or, if it were, if also his digestion? / Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude, / And conscience ask a curious sort of question, / About the right divine how far we should / Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one, / I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour / Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four. / Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide / Found life most tolerable after meals; / He 's wrong—unless man were a pig, indeed, / Repletion rather adds to what he feels, / Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed / From his own brain's oppression while it reels. / Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather / Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father); / I think with Alexander, that the act / Of eating, with another act or two, / Makes us feel our mortality in fact / Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout, / And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd, / Can give us either pain or pleasure, who / Would pique himself on intellects, whose use / Depends so much upon the gastric juice? / The other evening ('t was on Friday last)— / This is a fact and no poetic fable— / Just as my great coat was about me cast, / My hat and gloves still lying on the table, / I heard a shot—'t was eight o'clock scarce past— / And, running out as fast as I was able, / I found the military commandant / Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant. / Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad, / They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there / To perish on the pavement: so I had / Him borne into the house and up the stair, / And stripp'd and look'd to—But why should I ad / More circumstances? vain was every care; / The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel / Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel. / I gazed upon him, for I knew him well; / And though I have seen many corpses, never / Saw one, whom such an accident befell, / So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver, / He seem'd to sleep,—for you could scarcely tell / (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river / Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead: / So as I gazed on him, I thought or said— / 'Can this be death? then what is life or death? / Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:— / 'But yesterday and who had mightier breath? / A thousand warriors by his word were kept / In awe: he said, as the centurion saith, / ""Go,"" /  and he goeth;  / ""come,"" /  and forth he stepp'd. / The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb— / And now nought left him but the muffled drum.' / And they who waited once and worshipp'd—they / With their rough faces throng'd about the bed / To gaze once more on the commanding clay / Which for the last, though not the first, time bled: / And such an end! that he who many a day / Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,— / The foremost in the charge or in the sally, / Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley. / The scars of his old wounds were near his new, / Those honourable scars which brought him fame; / And horrid was the contrast to the view— / But let me quit the theme; as such things claim / Perhaps even more attention than is due / From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same) / To try if I could wrench aught out of death / Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith; / But it was all a mystery. Here we are, / And there we go:—but where? five bits of lead, / Or three, or two, or one, send very far! / And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed? / Can every element our elements mar? / And air—earth—water—fire live—and we dead? / We whose minds comprehend all things? No more; / But let us to the story as before. / The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance / Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat, / Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence / As fast as oars could pull and water float; / They look'd like persons being led to sentence, / Wondering what next, till the caique was brought / Up in a little creek below a wall / O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall. / Here their conductor tapping at the wicket / Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and / He led them onward, first through a low thicket / Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand: / They almost lost their way, and had to pick it— / For night was dosing ere they came to land. / The eunuch made a sign to those on board, / Who row'd off, leaving them without a word. / As they were plodding on their winding way / Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth / (Of which I might have a good deal to say, / There being no such profusion in the North / Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,' / But that of late your scribblers think it worth / Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works / Because one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)— / As they were threading on their way, there came / Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he / Whisper'd to his companion:—'t was the same / Which might have then occurr'd to you or me. / 'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame / If we should strike a stroke to set us free; / Let 's knock that old black fellow on the head, / And march away—'t were easier done than said.' / 'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then? / How get out? how the devil got we in? / And when we once were fairly out, and when / From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin, / To-morrow 'd see us in some other den, / And worse off than we hitherto have been; / Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take, / Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak. / 'We must be near some place of man's abode;— / For the old negro's confidence in creeping, / With his two captives, by so queer a road, / Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping; / A single cry would bring them all abroad: / 'T is therefore better looking before leaping— / And there, you see, this turn has brought us through, / By Jove, a noble palace!—lighted too.' / It was indeed a wide extensive building / Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front / There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding / And various hues, as is the Turkish won't,— / A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in / The arts of which these lands were once the font: / Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen / New painted, or a pretty opera-scene. / And nearer as they came, a genial savour / Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus, / Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour, / Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause, / And put himself upon his good behaviour: / His friend, too, adding a new saving clause, / Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now, / And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.' / Some talk of an appeal unto some passion, / Some to men's feelings, others to their reason; / The last of these was never much the fashion, / For reason thinks all reasoning out of season. / Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on, / But more or less continue still to tease on, / With arguments according to their 'forte;' / But no one dreams of ever being short.- / But I digress: of all appeals,—although / I grant the power of pathos, and of gold, / Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,—no / Method 's more sure at moments to take hold / Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow / More tender, as we every day behold, / Than that all-softening, overpowering knell, / The tocsin of the soul—the dinner-bell. / Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine; / And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard / No Christian knoll to table, saw no line / Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared, / Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine, / And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared, / And gazed around them to the left and right / With the prophetic eye of appetite. / And giving up all notions of resistance, / They follow'd close behind their sable guide, / Who little thought that his own crack'd existence / Was on the point of being set aside: / He motion'd them to stop at some small distance, / And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide, / And a magnificent large hall display'd / The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade. / I won't describe; description is my forte, / But every fool describes in these bright days / His wondrous journey to some foreign court, / And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise— / Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport; / While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways, / Resigns herself with exemplary patience / To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations. / Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted / Upon their hams, were occupied at chess; / Others in monosyllable talk chatted, / And some seem'd much in love with their own dress. / And divers smoked superb pipes decorated / With amber mouths of greater price or less; / And several strutted, others slept, and some / Prepared for supper with a glass of rum. / As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace / Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes / A moment without slackening from their pace; / But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise: / One or two stared the captives in the face, / Just as one views a horse to guess his price; / Some nodded to the negro from their station, / But no one troubled him with conversation. / He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping, / On through a farther range of goodly rooms, / Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping, / A marble fountain echoes through the glooms / Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping / Some female head most curiously presumes / To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice, / As wondering what the devil a noise that is. / Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls / Gave light enough to hint their farther way, / But not enough to show the imperial halls, / In all the flashing of their full array; / Perhaps there 's nothing—I 'll not say appals, / But saddens more by night as well as day, / Than an enormous room without a soul / To break the lifeless splendour of the whole. / Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing: / In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore, / There solitude, we know, has her full growth in / The spots which were her realms for evermore; / But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in / More modern buildings and those built of yore, / A kind of death comes o'er us all alone, / Seeing what 's meant for many with but one. / A neat, snug study on a winter's night, / A book, friend, single lady, or a glass / Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite, / Are things which make an English evening pass; / Though certes by no means so grand a sight / As is a theatre lit up by gas. / I pass my evenings in long galleries solely, / And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy. / Alas! man makes that great which makes him little: / I grant you in a church 't is very well: / What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle, / But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell / Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill— / And huge tombs worse—mankind, since Adam fell: / Methinks the story of the tower of Babel / Might teach them this much better than I 'm able. / Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then / A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing, / Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men, / Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing, / And Daniel tamed the lions in their den, / The people's awe and admiration raising; / 'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus, / And the calumniated queen Semiramis. / That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse / Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy) / Of an improper friendship for her horse / (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy): / This monstrous tale had probably its source / (For such exaggerations here and there I see) / In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:' / I wish the case could come before a jury here. / But to resume,—should there be (what may not / Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't, / Because they can't find out the very spot / Of that same Babel, or because they won't / (Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got, / And written lately two memoirs upon't), / Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who / Must be believed, though they believe not you, / Yet let them think that Horace has exprest / Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly / Of those, forgetting the great place of rest, / Who give themselves to architecture wholly; / We know where things and men must end at best: / A moral (like all morals) melancholy, / And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos' / Shows that we build when we should but entomb us. / At last they reach'd a quarter most retired, / Where echo woke as if from a long slumber; / Though full of all things which could be desired, / One wonder'd what to do with such a number / Of articles which nobody required; / Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber / With furniture an exquisite apartment, / Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant. / It seem'd, however, but to open on / A range or suite of further chambers, which / Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one / The movables were prodigally rich: / Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon, / So costly were they; carpets every stitch / Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish / You could glide o'er them like a golden fish. / The black, however, without hardly deigning / A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder, / Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining, / As if the milky way their feet was under / With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining / A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder— / In that remote recess which you may see— / Or if you don't the fault is not in me,— / I wish to be perspicuous; and the black, / I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth / A quantity of clothes fit for the back / Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth; / And of variety there was no lack— / And yet, though I have said there was no dearth, / He chose himself to point out what he thought / Most proper for the Christians he had bought. / The suit he thought most suitable to each / Was, for the elder and the stouter, first / A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach, / And trousers not so tight that they would burst, / But such as fit an Asiatic breech; / A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst, / Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy; / In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy. / While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend, / Hinted the vast advantages which they / Might probably attain both in the end, / If they would but pursue the proper way / Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend; / And then he added, that he needs must say, / ''T would greatly tend to better their condition, / If they would condescend to circumcision. / 'For his own part, he really should rejoice / To see them true believers, but no less / Would leave his proposition to their choice.' / The other, thanking him for this excess / Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice / In such a trifle, scarcely could express / 'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation / Of all the customs of this polish'd nation. / 'For his own share—he saw but small objection / To so respectable an ancient rite; / And, after swallowing down a slight refection, / For which he own'd a present appetite, / He doubted not a few hours of reflection / Would reconcile him to the business quite.' / 'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead, / But they as soon shall circumcise my head! / 'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'—'Now, pray,' / Replied the other, 'do not interrupt: / You put me out in what I had to say. / Sir!—as I said, as soon as I have supt, / I shall perpend if your proposal may / Be such as I can properly accept; / Provided always your great goodness still / Remits the matter to our own free-will.' / Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good / As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit / In which a Princess with great pleasure would / Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute, / As not being in a masquerading mood, / Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot; / And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,' / Replied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.' / 'What you may be, I neither know nor care,' / Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire: / I have no more time nor many words to spare.' / 'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire / The cause of this odd travesty?'—'Forbear,' / Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire, / No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season: / I have no authority to tell the reason.' / 'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'—'Hold!' / Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking; / This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold, / And you will find us not top fond of joking.' / 'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told / That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking / The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call / Those who will leave you of no sex at all. / 'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes: / A woman's, true; but then there is a cause / Why you should wear them.'—'What, though my soul loathes / The effeminate garb?'—thus, after a short pause, / Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths, / 'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?' / Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace / Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face. / And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd / A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk; / Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd, / Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk; / But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd, / Which—as we say—or, as the Scotch say, whilk / (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes / Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)— / Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to / His garment's novelty, and his being awkward: / And yet at last he managed to get through / His toilet, though no doubt a little backward: / The negro Baba help'd a little too, / When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard; / And, wrestling both his arms into a gown, / He paused, and took a survey up and down. / One difficulty still remain'd—his hair / Was hardly long enough; but Baba found / So many false long tresses all to spare, / That soon his head was most completely crown'd, / After the manner then in fashion there; / And this addition with such gems was bound / As suited the ensemble of his toilet, / While Baba made him comb his head and oil it. / And now being femininely all array'd, / With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers, / He look'd in almost all respects a maid, / And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs, / A perfect transformation here display'd; / And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs, / That is—the Lady:' clapping his hands twice, / Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice. / 'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one, / 'Will please to accompany those gentlemen / To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun, / Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when / I say a thing, it must at once be done. / What fear you? think you this a lion's den? / Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise / Anticipate the Prophet's paradise. / 'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.' / 'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them; / Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm, / Which is not quite so light as you may deem. / I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm / If any take me for that which I seem: / So that I trust for everybody's sake, / That this disguise may lead to no mistake.' / 'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while / Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who / Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile / Upon the metamorphosis in view,— / 'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil / Seems fertile in adventures strange and new; / One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid, / By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.' / 'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more, / I wish you a good appetite.'—'Farewell!' / Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore; / When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell: / We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore. / Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.' / 'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me, / Unless his highness promises to marry me. / And thus they parted, each by separate doors; / Baba led Juan onward room by room / Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors, / Till a gigantic portal through the gloom, / Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers; / And wafted far arose a rich perfume: / It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine, / For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine. / The giant door was broad, and bright, and high, / Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise; / Warriors thereon were battling furiously; / Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies; / There captives led in triumph droop the eye, / And in perspective many a squadron flies: / It seems the work of times before the line / Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine. / This massy portal stood at the wide close / Of a huge hall, and on its either side / Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose, / Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied / In mockery to the enormous gate which rose / O'er them in almost pyramidic pride: / The gate so splendid was in all its features, / You never thought about those little creatures, / Until you nearly trod on them, and then / You started back in horror to survey / The wondrous hideousness of those small men, / Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey, / But an extraneous mixture, which no pen / Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may; / They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb— / Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum. / Their duty was—for they were strong, and though / They look'd so little, did strong things at times— / To ope this door, which they could really do, / The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes; / And now and then, with tough strings of the bow, / As is the custom of those Eastern climes, / To give some rebel Pacha a cravat; / For mutes are generally used for that. / They spoke by signs—that is, not spoke at all; / And looking like two incubi, they glared / As Baba with his fingers made them fall / To heaving back the portal folds: it scared / Juan a moment, as this pair so small / With shrinking serpent optics on him stared; / It was as if their little looks could poison / Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on. / Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint / To Juan some slight lessons as his guide: / 'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint / That somewhat manly majesty of stride, / 'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't) / To swing a little less from side to side, / Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;— / And also could you look a little modest, / ''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes / Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats; / And if they should discover your disguise, / You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats; / And you and I may chance, ere morning rise, / To find our way to Marmora without boats, / Stitch'd up in sacks—a mode of navigation / A good deal practised here upon occasion.' / With this encouragement, he led the way / Into a room still nobler than the last; / A rich confusion form'd a disarray / In such sort, that the eye along it cast / Could hardly carry anything away, / Object on object flash'd so bright and fast; / A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter, / Magnificently mingled in a litter. / Wealth had done wonders—taste not much; such things / Occur in Orient palaces, and even / In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings / (Of which I have also seen some six or seven), / Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings / Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven; / Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures, / On which I cannot pause to make my strictures. / In this imperial hall, at distance lay / Under a canopy, and there reclined / Quite in a confidential queenly way, / A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd / To Juan, who though not much used to pray, / Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind, / What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended / His head, until the ceremony ended. / The lady rising up with such an air / As Venus rose with from the wave, on them / Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair / Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem; / And raising up an arm as moonlight fair, / She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem / Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low, / Pointed to Juan who remain'd below. / Her presence was as lofty as her state; / Her beauty of that overpowering kind, / Whose force description only would abate: / I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind, / Than lessen it by what I could relate / Of forms and features; it would strike you blind / Could I do justice to the full detail; / So, luckily for both, my phrases fail. / Thus much however I may add,—her years / Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs; / But there are forms which Time to touch forbears, / And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things, / Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true—tears / And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings / Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow / Ugly; for instance—Ninon de l'Enclos. / She spake some words to her attendants, who / Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen, / And were all clad alike; like Juan, too, / Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen; / They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew, / Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,' / As far as outward show may correspond; / I won't be bail for anything beyond. / They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring, / But not by the same door through which came in / Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring, / At some small distance, all he saw within / This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring / Marvel and praise; for both or none things win; / And I must say, I ne'er could see the very / Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.' / 'Not to admire is all the art I know / (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech) / To make men happy, or to keep them so' / (So take it in the very words of Creech)— / Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago; / And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach / From his translation; but had none admired, / Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired? / Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn, / Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then / A second time desired him to kneel down, / And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when / He heard repeated, Juan with a frown / Drew himself up to his full height again, / And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop / To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.' / Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride, / Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat / He mutter'd (but the last was given aside) / About a bow-string—quite in vain; not yet / Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride: / There 's nothing in the world like etiquette / In kingly chambers or imperial halls, / As also at the race and county balls. / He stood like Atlas, with a world of words / About his ears, and nathless would not bend: / The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords / Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend / To stain his pedigree a thousand swords / A thousand times of him had made an end; / At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand, / Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand. / Here was an honourable compromise, / A half-way house of diplomatic rest, / Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise; / And Juan now his willingness exprest / To use all fit and proper courtesies, / Adding, that this was commonest and best, / For through the South the custom still commands / The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands. / And he advanced, though with but a bad grace, / Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers / No lips e'er left their transitory trace; / On such as these the lip too fondly lingers, / And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace, / As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers / In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's / An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers. / The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade / Baba retire, which he obey'd in style, / As if well used to the retreating trade; / And taking hints in good part all the while, / He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid, / And looking on him with a sort of smile, / Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction / As good men wear who have done a virtuous action. / When he was gone, there was a sudden change: / I know not what might be the lady's thought, / But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange, / And into her dear cheek the blood was brought, / Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range / The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought, / A mixture of sensations might be scann'd, / Of half voluptuousness and half command. / Her form had all the softness of her sex, / Her features all the sweetness of the devil, / When he put on the cherub to perplex / Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil; / The sun himself was scarce more free from specks / Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil; / Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting, / As if she rather order'd than was granting. / Something imperial, or imperious, threw / A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain / Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,— / And rapture's self will seem almost a pain / With aught which looks like despotism in view: / Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain / We would against them make the flesh obey— / The spirit in the end will have its way. / Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet; / Her very nod was not an inclination; / There was a self-will even in her small feet, / As though they were quite conscious of her station— / They trod as upon necks; and to complete / Her state (it is the custom of her nation), / A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign / She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!). / 'To hear and to obey' had been from birth / The law of all around her; to fulfill / All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth, / Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will; / Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth: / Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still; / Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion / We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.' / Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought; / Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed / It might be seen, with diligence was sought, / And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed; / There was no end unto the things she bought, / Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused; / Yet even her tyranny had such a grace, / The women pardon'd all except her face. / Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught / Her eye in passing on his way to sale; / She order'd him directly to be bought, / And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail / In any kind of mischief to be wrought, / At all such auctions knew how to prevail: / She had no prudence, but he had; and this / Explains the garb which Juan took amiss. / His youth and features favour'd the disguise, / And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride, / Could risk or compass such strange phantasies, / This I must leave sultanas to decide: / Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes, / And kings and consorts oft are mystified, / As we may ascertain with due precision, / Some by experience, others by tradition. / But to the main point, where we have been tending:— / She now conceived all difficulties past, / And deem'd herself extremely condescending / When, being made her property at last, / Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending / Passion and power, a glance on him she cast, / And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?' / Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move / And so it was, in proper time and place; / But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing / With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face, / Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing, / Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace, / And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing; / These words went through his soul like Arab-spears, / So that he spoke not, but burst into tears. / She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears, / For women shed and use them at their liking; / But there is something when man's eye appears / Wet, still more disagreeable and striking; / A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears, / Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in / His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter) / To them 't is a relief, to us a torture. / And she would have consoled, but knew not how: / Having no equals, nothing which had e'er / Infected her with sympathy till now, / And never having dreamt what 't was to bear / Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although / There might arise some pouting petty care / To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near / Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear. / But nature teaches more than power can spoil, / And, when a strong although a strange sensation / Moves—female hearts are such a genial soil / For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation, / They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,' / Samaritans in every situation; / And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why, / Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye. / But tears must stop like all things else; and soon / Juan, who for an instant had been moved / To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone / Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,' / Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone / Bright with the very weakness he reproved; / And although sensitive to beauty, he / Felt most indignant still at not being free. / Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days, / Was much embarrass'd, never having met / In all her life with aught save prayers and praise; / And as she also risk'd her life to get / Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways / Into a comfortable tete-a-tete, / To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr, / And they had wasted now almost a quarter. / I also would suggest the fitting time / To gentlemen in any such like case, / That is to say in a meridian clime— / With us there is more law given to the chase, / But here a small delay forms a great crime: / So recollect that the extremest grace / Is just two minutes for your declaration— / A moment more would hurt your reputation. / Juan's was good; and might have been still better, / But he had got Haidee into his head: / However strange, he could not yet forget her, / Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred. / Gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor / For having had him to her palace led, / Began to blush up to the eyes, and then / Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again. / At length, in an imperial way, she laid / Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes / Which needed not an empire to persuade, / Look'd into his for love, where none replies: / Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid, / That being the last thing a proud woman tries; / She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw / Herself upon his breast, and there she grew. / This was an awkward test, as Juan found, / But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride: / With gentle force her white arms he unwound, / And seated her all drooping by his side, / Then rising haughtily he glanced around, / And looking coldly in her face, he cried, / 'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor / Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy. / 'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof / How much I have loved—that I love not thee! / In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof, / Were fitter for me: Love is for the free! / I am not dazzled by this splendid roof, / Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be; / Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne, / And hands obey—our hearts are still our own.' / This was a truth to us extremely trite; / Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things: / She deem'd her least command must yield delight, / Earth being only made for queens and kings. / If hearts lay on the left side or the right / She hardly knew, to such perfection brings / Legitimacy its born votaries, when / Aware of their due royal rights o'er men. / Besides, as has been said, she was so fair / As even in a much humbler lot had made / A kingdom or confusion anywhere, / And also, as may be presumed, she laid / Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er, / By their possessors thrown into the shade: / She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;' / And half of that opinion 's also mine. / Remember, or (if you can not) imagine, / Ye, who have kept your chastity when young, / While some more desperate dowager has been waging / Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung / By your refusal, recollect her raging! / Or recollect all that was said or sung / On such a subject; then suppose the face / Of a young downright beauty in this case. / Suppose,—but you already have supposed, / The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby, / Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed / Of good examples; pity that so few by / Poets and private tutors are exposed, / To educate—ye youth of Europe—you by! / But when you have supposed the few we know, / You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow. / A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness, / Or any interesting beast of prey, / Are similes at hand for the distress / Of ladies who can not have their own way; / But though my turn will not be served with less, / These don't express one half what I should say: / For what is stealing young ones, few or many, / To cutting short their hopes of having any? / The love of offspring 's nature's general law, / From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings; / There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw / Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings; / And all who have seen a human nursery, saw / How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings; / This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer / Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger. / If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes, / 'T were nothing—for her eyes flash'd always fire; / Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes, / I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer, / So supernatural was her passion's rise; / For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire: / Even ye who know what a check'd woman is / (Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this. / Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well— / A moment's more had slain her; but the while / It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell: / Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile, / Though horrible to see yet grand to tell, / Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle; / And the deep passions flashing through her form / Made her a beautiful embodied storm. / A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon / To match a common fury with her rage, / And yet she did not want to reach the moon, / Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page; / Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune, / Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age— / Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's, / And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears. / A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd, / Pass'd without words—in fact she could not speak; / And then her sex's shame broke in at last, / A sentiment till then in her but weak, / But now it flow'd in natural and fast, / As water through an unexpected leak; / For she felt humbled—and humiliation / Is sometimes good for people in her station / It teaches them that they are flesh and blood, / It also gently hints to them that others, / Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud; / That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers, / And works of the same pottery, bad or good, / Though not all born of the same sires and mothers: / It teaches—Heaven knows only what it teaches, / But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches. / Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head; / Her second, to cut only his—acquaintance; / Her third, to ask him where he had been bred; / Her fourth, to rally him into repentance; / Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed; / Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence / The lash to Baba:—but her grand resource / Was to sit down again, and cry of course. / She thought to stab herself, but then she had / The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward; / For Eastern stays are little made to pad, / So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard: / She thought of killing Juan—but, poor lad! / Though he deserved it well for being so backward, / The cutting off his head was not the art / Most likely to attain her aim—his heart. / Juan was moved; he had made up his mind / To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish / For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined, / Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish, / And thus heroically stood resign'd, / Rather than sin—except to his own wish: / But all his great preparatives for dying / Dissolved like snow before a woman crying. / As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed, / So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how; / And first he wonder'd why he had refused; / And then, if matters could be made up now; / And next his savage virtue he accused, / Just as a friar may accuse his vow, / Or as a dame repents her of her oath, / Which mostly ends in some small breach of both. / So he began to stammer some excuses; / But words are not enough in such a matter, / Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses / Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter, / Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses; / Just as a languid smile began to flatter / His peace was making, but before he ventured / Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd. / 'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!' / ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth! / Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune, / Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth, / Your slave brings tidings—he hopes not too soon— / Which your sublime attention may be worth: / The Sun himself has sent me like a ray, / To hint that he is coming up this way.' / 'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say? / I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning! / But bid my women form the milky way. / Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning— / And, Christian! mingle with them as you may, / And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-' / Here they were interrupted by a humming / Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!' / First came her damsels, a decorous file, / And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white; / The train might reach a quarter of a mile: / His majesty was always so polite / As to announce his visits a long while / Before he came, especially at night; / For being the last wife of the Emperour, / She was of course the favorite of the four. / His Highness was a man of solemn port, / Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes, / Snatch'd from a prison to preside at court, / His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise; / He was as good a sovereign of the sort / As any mention'd in the histories / Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine / Save Solyman, the glory of their line. / He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers / With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;' / He left to his vizier all state affairs, / And show'd but little royal curiosity: / I know not if he had domestic cares— / No process proved connubial animosity; / Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen, / Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen. / If now and then there happen'd a slight slip, / Little was heard of criminal or crime; / The story scarcely pass'd a single lip— / The sack and sea had settled all in time, / From which the secret nobody could rip: / The Public knew no more than does this rhyme; / No scandals made the daily press a curse— / Morals were better, and the fish no worse. / He saw with his own eyes the moon was round, / Was also certain that the earth was square, / Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found / No sign that it was circular anywhere; / His empire also was without a bound: / 'T is true, a little troubled here and there, / By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours, / But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;' / Except in shape of envoys, who were sent / To lodge there when a war broke out, according / To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant / Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in / Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent / Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording / Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or / The singeing of a single inky whisker. / He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons, / Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd, / The former in a palace, where like nuns / They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad, / When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once, / Sometimes at six years old—though it seems odd, / 'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw / Must make a present to his sire in law. / His sons were kept in prison, till they grew / Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne, / One or the other, but which of the two / Could yet be known unto the fates alone; / Meantime the education they went through / Was princely, as the proofs have always shown: / So that the heir apparent still was found / No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd. / His majesty saluted his fourth spouse / With all the ceremonies of his rank, / Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows, / As suits a matron who has play'd a prank; / These must seem doubly mindful of their vows, / To save the credit of their breaking bank: / To no men are such cordial greetings given / As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven. / His Highness cast around his great black eyes, / And looking, as he always look'd, perceived / Juan amongst the damsels in disguise, / At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved, / But just remark'd with air sedate and wise, / While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved, / 'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity / That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.' / This compliment, which drew all eyes upon / The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake. / Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone: / O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take / Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one / Of them his lips imperial ever spake! / There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle, / But etiquette forbade them all to giggle. / The Turks do well to shut—at least, sometimes— / The women up, because, in sad reality, / Their chastity in these unhappy climes / Is not a thing of that astringent quality / Which in the North prevents precocious crimes, / And makes our snow less pure than our morality; / The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice, / Has quite the contrary effect on vice. / Thus in the East they are extremely strict, / And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same; / Excepting only when the former 's pick'd / It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame; / Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd: / But then their own Polygamy 's to blame; / Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life / Into that moral centaur, man and wife? / Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause, / Though not for want of matter; but 't is time / According to the ancient epic laws, / To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme. / Let this fifth canto meet with due applause, / The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime; / Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps / You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'N/A', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Romanticism Literature', 'Poetry', 'Literature']}"

Her colour was changed and her eyes were sunken; but, when she saw me, she exclaimed, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety!"" And she was minded to rise but fell down for joy. I was abashed before her and hung my head; presently, however, I went up to her and kissed her and asked, ""How knewest thou that I should come to thee this very night?"" She answered, ""I knew it not! By Allah, this whole year past I have not tasted the taste of sleep, but have watched through every night, expecting thee; and such hath been my case since the day thou wentest out from me and I gave thee the new suit of clothes, and thou promisedst me to go to the Hammam and to come back! So I sat awaiting thee that night and a second night and a third night; but thou camest not till after so great delay, and I ever expecting thy coming; for this is lovers' way. And now I would have thee tell me what hath been the cause of thine absence from me the past year long?"" So I told her. And when she knew that I was married, her colour waxed yellow, and I added, ""I have come to thee this night but I must leave thee before day."" Quoth she, ""Doth it not suffice her that she tricked thee into marrying her and kept thee prisoner with her a whole year, but she must also make thee swear by the oath of divorce, that thou wilt return to her on the same night before morning, and not allow thee to divert thyself with thy mother or me, nor suffer thee to pass one night with either of us, away from her? How then must it be with one from whom thou hast been absent a full year, and I knew thee before she did? But Allah have mercy on thy cousin Azizah, for there befel her what never befel any and she bore what none other ever bore and she died by thy ill usage; yet 'twas she who protected thee against me. Indeed, I thought thou didst love me, so I let thee take thine own way; else had I not suffered thee to go safe in a sound skin, when I had it in my power to clap thee in jail and even to slay thee."" Then she wept with sore weeping and waxed wroth and shuddered in my face with skin bristling[FN#1] and looked at me with furious eyes. When I saw her in this case I was terrified at her and my side muscles trembled and quivered, for she was like a dreadful she Ghul, an ogress in ire, and I like a bean over the fire. Then said she, ""Thou art of no use to me, now thou art married and hast a child; nor art thou any longer fit for my company; I care only for bachelors and not for married men:[FN#2] these profit us nothing Thou hast sold me for yonder stinking armful; but, by Allah, I will make the whore's heart ache for thee, and thou shalt not live either for me or for her!"" Then she cried a loud cry and, ere I could think, up came the slave girls and threw me on the ground; and when I was helpless under their hands she rose and, taking a knife, said, ""I will cut thy throat as they slaughter he goats; and that will be less than thy desert, for thy doings to me and the daughter of thy uncle before me."" When I looked to my life and found myself at the mercy of her slave women, with my cheeks dust soiled, and saw her sharpen the knife, I made sure of death.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued his tale to Zau al-Makan: Then quoth the youth Aziz to Taj al-Muluk, Now when I found my life at the mercy of her slave women with my cheeks dust soiled, and I saw her sharpen the knife, I made sure of death and cried out to her for mercy. But she only redoubled in ferocity and ordered the slave girls to pinion my hands behind me, which they did; and, throwing me on my back, she seated herself on my middle and held down my head. Then two of them came up and squatted on my shin bones, whilst other two grasped my hands and arms; and she summoned a third pair and bade them beat me. So they beat me till I fainted and my voice failed. When I revived, I said to myself, "" 'Twere easier and better for me to have my gullet slit than to be beaten on this wise!"" And I remembered the words of my cousin, and how she used to say to me, ""Allah, keep thee from her mischief!""; and I shrieked and wept till my voice failed and I remained without power to breathe or to move. Then she again whetted the knife and said to the slave girls, ""Uncover him."" Upon this the Lord inspired me to repeat to her the two phrases my cousin had taught me, and had bequeathed to me, and I said, ""O my lady, dost thou not know that Faith is fair, Unfaith is foul?"" When she heard this, she cried out and said, ""Allah pity thee, Azizah, and give thee Paradise in exchange for thy wasted youth! By Allah, of a truth she served thee in her life time and after her death, and now she hath saved thee alive out of my hands with these two saws. Nevertheless, I cannot by any means leave thee thus, but needs must I set my mark on thee, to spite yonder brazen faced piece, who hath kept thee from me."" There upon she called out to the slave women and bade them bind my feet with cords and then said to them, ""Take seat on him!"" They did her bidding, upon which she arose and fetched a pan of copper and hung it over the brazier and poured into it oil of sesame, in which she fried cheese.[FN#3] Then she came up to me (and I still insensible) and, unfastening my bag trousers, tied a cord round my testicles and, giving it to two of her women, bade them trawl at it. They did so, and I swooned away and was for excess of pain in a world other than this. Then she came with a razor of steel and cut off my member masculine,[FN#4] so that I remained like a woman: after which she seared the wound with the boiling and rubbed it with a powder, and I the while unconscious. Now when I came to myself, the blood had stopped; so she bade the slave girls unbind me and made me drink a cup of wine. Then said she to me, ""Go now to her whom thou hast married and who grudged me a single night, and the mercy of Allah be on thy cousin Azizah, who saved thy life and never told her secret love! Indeed, haddest thou not repeated those words to me, I had surely slit thy weasand. Go forth this instant to whom thou wilt, for I needed naught of thee save what I have just cut off; and now I have no part in thee, nor have I any further want of thee or care for thee. So begone about thy business and rub thy head[FN#5] and implore mercy for the daughter of thine uncle!"" Thereupon she kicked me with her foot and I rose, hardly able to walk; and I went, little by little, till I came to the door of our house. I saw it was open, so I threw myself within it and fell down in a fainting fit; whereupon my wife came out and lifting me up, carried me into the saloon and assured herself that I had become like a woman. Then I fell into a sleep and a deep sleep; and when I awoke, I found myself thrown down at the garden gate,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan pursued to King Zau al-Makan, The youth Aziz thus continued his story to Taj al-Muluk: When I awoke and found myself thrown down at the garden gate, I rose, groaning for pain and misery, and made my way to our home and entering, I came upon my mother weeping for me, and saying, ""Would I knew, O my son, in what land art thou?"" So I drew near and threw myself upon her, and when she looked at me and felt me, she knew that I was ill; for my face was coloured black and tan. Then I thought of my cousin and all the kind offices she had been won't to do me, and I learned when too late that she had truly loved me; so I wept for her and my mother wept also Presently she said to me, ""O my son, thy sire is dead."" At this my fury against Fate redoubled, and I cried till I fell into a fit. When I came to myself, I looked at the place where my cousin Azizah had been used to sit and shed tears anew, till I all but fainted once more for excess of weeping; and I ceased not to cry and sob and wail till midnight, when my mother said to me, ""Thy father hath been dead these ten days."" ""I shall never think of any one but my cousin Azizah,"" replied I; ""and indeed I deserve all that hath befallen me, for that I neglected her who loved me with love so dear."" Asked she, ""What hath befallen thee?"" So I told her all that had happened and she wept awhile, then she rose and set some matter of meat and drink before me. I ate a little and drank, after which I repeated my story to her, and told her the whole occurrence; whereupon she exclaimed, ""Praised be Allah, that she did but this to thee and forbore to slaughter thee!"" Then she nursed me and medicined me till I regained my health; and, when my recovery was complete, she said to me, ""O my son, I will now bring out to thee that which thy cousin committed to me in trust for thee; for it is thine. She swore me not to give it thee, till I should see thee recalling her to mind and weeping over her and thy connection severed from other than herself; and now I know that these conditions are fulfilled in thee."" So she arose, and opening a chest, took out this piece of linen, with the figures of gazelles worked thereon, which I had given to Azizah in time past; and taking it I found written therein these couplets, / ""Lady of beauty, say, who taught thee hard and harsh design, * /          To slay with longing Love's excess this hapless lover thine? / An thou fain disremember me beyond our parting day, * Allah will /          know, that thee and thee my memory never shall tyne. / Thou blamest me with bitter speech yet sweetest 'tis to me; * /          Wilt generous be and deign one day to show of love a sign? / I had not reckoned Love contained so much of pine and pain; * /          And soul distress until I came for thee to pain and pine / Never my heart knew weariness, until that eve I fell * In love /          wi' thee, and prostrate fell before those glancing eyne! / My very foes have mercy on my case and moan therefor; * But thou, /          O heart of Indian steel, all mercy dost decline. / No, never will I be consoled, by Allah, an I die, * Nor yet /          forget the love of thee though life in ruins lie!""When I read these couplets, I wept with sore weeping and buffeted my face; then I unfolded the scroll, and there fell from it an other paper. I opened it and behold, I found written therein, 'Know, O son of my uncle, that I acquit thee of my blood and I beseech Allah to make accord between thee and her whom thou lovest; but if aught befal thee through the daughter of Dalilah the Wily, return thou not to her neither resort to any other woman and patiently bear thine affliction, for were not thy fated life tide a long life, thou hadst perished long ago; but praised be Allah who hath appointed my death day before thine! My peace be upon thee; preserve this cloth with the gazelles herein figured and let it not leave thee, for it was my companion when thou was absent from me;""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan pursued to King Zau al-Makan, And the youth Aziz continued to Taj al-Muluk: So I read what my cousin had written and the charge to me which was, ""Preserve this cloth with the gazelles and let it not leave thee, for it was my companion when thou west absent from me and, Allah upon thee! if thou chance to fall in with her who worked these gazelles, hold aloof from her and do not let her approach thee nor marry her; and if thou happen not on her and find no way to her, look thou consort not with any of her sex. Know that she who wrought these gazelles worketh every year a gazelle cloth and despatcheth it to far countries, that her report and the beauty of her broidery, which none in the world can match, may be bruited abroad. As for thy beloved, the daughter of Dalilah the Wily, this cloth came to her hand, and she used to ensnare folk with it, showing it to them and saying, 'I have a sister who wrought this.' But she lied in so saying, Allah rend her veil! This is my parting counsel; and I have not charged thee with this charge, but because I know[FN#6] that after my death the world will be straitened on thee and, haply, by reason of this, thou wilt leave thy native land and wander in foreign parts, and hearing of her who wrought these figures, thou mayest be minded to fore gather with her. Then wilt thou remember me, when the memory shall not avail thee; nor wilt thou know my worth till after my death. And, lastly, learn that she who wrought the gazelles is the daughter of the King of the Camphor Islands and a lady of the noblest."" Now when I had read that scroll and understood what was written therein, I fell again to weeping, and my mother wept because I wept, and I ceased not to gaze upon it and to shed tears till night fall. I abode in this condition a whole year, at the end of which the merchants, with whom I am in this cafilah, prepared to set out from my native town; and my mother counseled me to equip myself and journey with them, so haply I might be consoled and my sorrow be dispelled, saying, ""Take comfort and put away from thee this mourning and travel for a year or two or three, till the caravan return, when perhaps thy breast may be broadened and thy heart heartened."" And she ceased not to persuade me with endearing words, till I provided myself with merchandise and set out with the caravan. But all the time of my wayfaring, my tears have never dried; no, never! and at every halting place where we halt, I open this piece of linen and look on these gazelles and call to mind my cousin Azizah and weep for her as thou hast seen; for indeed she loved me with dearest love and died, oppressed by my unlove. I did her nought but ill and she did me nought but good. When these merchants return from their journey, I shall return with them, by which time I shall have been absent a whole year: yet hath my sorrow waxed greater and my grief and affliction were but increased by my visit to the Islands of Camphor and the Castle of Crystal. Now these islands are seven in number and are ruled by a King, by name Shahriman,[FN#7] who hath a daughter called Dunyá;[FN#8] and I was told that it was she who wrought these gazelles and that this piece in my possession was of her embroidery. When I knew this, my yearning redoubled and I burnt with the slow fire of pining and was drowned in the sea of sad thought; and I wept over myself for that I was become even as a woman, without manly tool like other men, and there was no help for it. From the day of my quitting the Camphor Islands, I have been tearful eyed and heavy hearted, and such hath been my case for a long while and I know not whether it will be given me to return to my native land and die beside my mother or not; for I am sick from eating too much of the world. Thereupon the young merchant wept and groaned and complained and gazed upon the gazelles; whilst the tears rolled down his cheeks in streams and he repeated these two couplets, / ""Joy needs shall come,"" a prattler 'gan to prattle: * /          ""Needs cease thy blame!"" I was commoved to rattle: / 'In time,' quoth he: quoth I ' 'Tis marvellous! * /          Who shall ensure my life, O cold of tattle!'""[FN#9] / And he repeated also these, / ""Well Allah weets that since our severance day * /          I've wept till forced to ask of tears a loan: / 'Patience! (the blamer cries): thou'lt have her yet!' * /          Quoth I, 'O blamer where may patience wone?'"" / Then said he, ""This, O King! is my tale: hast thou ever heard one stranger?"" So Taj al-Muluk marvelled with great marvel at the young merchant's story, and fire darted into his entrails on hearing the name of the Lady Dunya and her loveliness.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan: Now when Taj al-Muluk heard the story of the young merchant, he marvelled with great marvel and fire darted into his entrails on hearing the name of the Lady Dunya who, as he knew, had embroidered the gazelles; and his love and longing hourly grew, so he said to the youth, ""By Allah, that hath befallen thee whose like never befel any save thyself, but thou hast a life term appointed, which thou must fulfil; and now I would fain ask of thee a question."" Quoth Aziz, ""And what is it?"" Quoth he, ""Wilt thou tell me how thou sawest the young lady who wrought these gazelles?"" Then he, ""O my lord, I got me access to her by a sleight and it was this. When I entered her city with the caravan, I went forth and wandered about the garths till I came to a flower garden abounding in trees, whose keeper was a venerable old man, a Shaykh stricken in years. I addressed him, saying, 'O ancient sir, whose may be this garden?' and he replied, 'It belongs to the King's daughter, the Lady Dunya. We are now beneath her palace and, when she is minded to amuse herself, she openeth the private wicket and walketh in the garden and smelleth the fragrance of the flowers.' So I said to him, 'Favour me by allowing me to sit in this garden till she come; haply I may enjoy a sight of her as she passeth.' The Shaykh answered, 'There can be no harm in that.' Thereupon I gave him a dirham or so and said to him, Buy us something to eat.' He took the money gladly and opened door and, entering himself, admitted me into the garden, where we strolled and ceased not strolling till we reached a pleasant spot in which he bade me sit down and await his going and his returning. Then he brought me somewhat of fruit and, leaving me, disappeared for an hour; but after a while he returned to me bringing a roasted lamb, of which we ate till we had eaten enough, my heart yearning the while for a sight of the lady. Presently, as we sat, the postern opened and the keeper said to me, 'Rise and hide thee.' I did so; and behold, a black eunuch put his head out through the garden wicket and asked, 'O Shaykh, there any one with thee?' 'No,' answered he; and the eunuch said, 'Shut the garden gate.' So the keeper shut the gate, and lo! the Lady Dunya came in by the private door. When I saw her, methought the moon had risen above the horizon and was shining; I looked at her a full hour and longed for her as one athirst longeth for water. After a while she withdrew and shut the door; whereupon I left the garden and sought my lodging, knowing that I could not get at her and that I was no man for her, more especially as I was become like a woman, having no manly tool: moreover she was a King's daughter and I but a merchant man; so; how could I have access to the like of her or— to any other woman? Accordingly, when these my companions made ready for the road, I also made preparation and set out with them, and we journeyed towards this city till we arrived at the place ere we met with thee. Thou askedst me and I have answered; and these are my adventures and peace be with thee!"" Now when Taj al-Muluk heard that account, fires raged in his bosom and his heart and thought were occupied love for the Lady Dunya; and passion and longing were sore upon him. Then he arose and mounted horse and, taking Aziz with him, returned to his father's capital, where he settled him in a separate house and supplied him with all he needed in the way of meat and drink and dress. Then he left him and returned to his palace, with the tears trickling down his cheeks, for hearing oftentimes standeth instead of seeing and knowing.[FN#10] And he ceased not to be in this state till his father came in to him and finding him wan faced, lean of limb and tearful eyed, knew that something had occurred to chagrin him and said, ""O my son, acquaint me with thy case and tell me what hath befallen thee, that thy colour is changed and thy body is wasted. So he told him all that had passed and what tale he had heard of Aziz and the account of the Princess Dunya; and how he had fallen in love of her on hearsay, without having set eyes on her. Quoth his sire, ""O my son, she is the daughter of a King whose land is far from ours: so put away this thought and go in to thy mother's palace.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirtieth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan: And the father of Taj al-Muluk spake to him on this wise, ""O my son, her father is a King whose land is far from ours: so put away this thought and go into thy mother's palace where are five hundred maidens like moons, and whichsoever of them pleaseth thee, take her; or else we will seek for thee in marriage some one of the King's daughters, fairer than the Lady Dunya."" Answered Taj al-Muluk, ""O my father, I desire none other, for she it is who wrought the gazelles which I saw, and there is no help but that I have her; else I will flee into the world and the waste and I will slay myself for her sake."" Then said his father, ""Have patience with me, till I send to her sire and demand her in marriage, and win thee thy wish as I did for myself with thy mother. Haply Allah will bring thee to thy desire; and, if her parent will not consent, I will make his kingdom quake under him with an army, whose rear shall be with me whilst its van shall be upon him."" Then he sent for the youth Aziz and asked him, ""O my son, tell me dost thou know the way to the Camphor Islands?"" He answered ""Yes""; and the King said, ""I desire of thee that thou fare with my Wazir thither."" Replied Aziz, ""I hear and I obey, O King of the Age!""; where upon the King summoned his Minister and said to him, ""Devise me some device, whereby my son's affair may be rightly managed and fare thou forth to the Camphor Islands and demand of their King his daughter in marriage for my son, Taj al-Muluk."" The Wazir replied, ""Hearkening and obedience."" Then Taj al-Muluk returned to his dwelling place and his love and longing redoubled and the delay seemed endless to him; and when the night darkened around him, he wept and sighed and complained and repeated this poetry,""Dark falls the night: my tears unaided rail * And fiercest /          flames of love my heart assail: / Ask thou the nights of me, and they shall tell * An I find aught /          to do but weep and wail: / Night long awake, I watch the stars what while * Pour down my /          cheeks the tears like dropping hail: / And lone and lorn I'm grown with none to aid; * For kith and kin /          the love lost lover fail."" / And when he had ended his reciting he swooned away and did not recover his senses till the morning, at which time there came to him one of his father's eunuchs and, standing at his head, summoned him to the King's presence. So he went with him and his father, seeing that his pallor had increased, exhorted him to patience and promised him union with her he loved. Then he equipped Aziz and the Wazir and supplied them with presents; and they set out and fared on day and night till they drew near the Isles of Camphor, where they halted on the banks of a stream, and the Minister despatched a messenger to acquaint the King of his arrival. The messenger hurried forwards and had not been gone more than an hour, before they saw the King's Chamberlains and Emirs advancing towards them, to meet them at a parasang's distance from the city and escort them into the royal presence. They laid their gifts before the King and became his guests for three days. And on the fourth day the Wazir rose and going in to the King, stood between his hands and acquainted him with the object which induced his visit; whereat he was perplexed for an answer inasmuch as his daughter misliked men and disliked marriage. So he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raised it and calling one of his eunuchs, said to him, ""Go to thy mistress, the Lady Dunya, and repeat to her what thou hast heard and the purport of this Wazir's coming."" So the eunuch went forth and returning after a time, said to the King, ""O King of the Age, when I went in to the Lady Dunya and told her what I had heard, she was wroth with exceeding wrath and rose at me with a staff designing to break my head; so I fled from her, and she said to me 'If my Father force me to wed him, whomsoever I wed I will slay.' Then said her sire to the Wazir and Aziz, ""Ye have heard, and now ye know all! So let your King wot of it and give him my salutations and say that my daughter misliketh men and disliketh marriage.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-first Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman thus addressed the Wazir and Aziz, ""Salute your King from me and inform him of what ye have heard, namely that my daughter misliketh marriage."" So they turned away unsuccessful and ceased not faring on till they rejoined the King and told him what had passed; whereupon he commanded the chief officers to summon the troops and get them ready for marching and campaigning. But the Wazir said to him, ""O my liege Lord, do not thus: the King is not at fault because, when his daughter learnt our business, she sent a message saying, 'If my father force me to wed, whomsoever I wed I will slay and myself after him.' So the refusal cometh from her."" When the King heard his Minister's words he feared for Taj al-Muluk and said, ""Verily if I make war on the King of the Camphor Islands and carry off his daughter, she will kill herself and it will avail me naught."" Then he told his son how the case stood, who hearing it said, ""O my father, I cannot live without her; so I will go to her and contrive to get at her, even though I die in the attempt, and this only will I do and nothing else."" Asked his father, ""How wilt thou go to her?"" and he answered, ""I will go in the guise of a merchant.""[FN#11] Then said the King, ""If thou need must go and there is no help for it, take with thee the Wazir and Aziz."" Then he brought out money from his treasuries and made ready for his son merchandise to the value of an hundred thousand dinars. The two had settled upon this action; and when the dark hours came Taj al-Muluk and Aziz went to Aziz's lodgings and there passed that night, and the Prince was heart smitten, taking no pleasure in food or in sleep; for melancholy was heavy upon him and he was agitated with longing for his beloved. So he besought the Creator that he would vouch safe to unite him with her and he wept and groaned and wailed and began versifying, / ""Union, this severance ended, shall I see some day? * Then shall /          my tears this love lorn lot of me portray. / While night all care forgets I only minded thee, * And thou didst /          gar me wake while all forgetful lay."" / And when his improvising came to an end, he wept with sore weeping and Aziz wept with him, for that he remembered his cousin; and they both ceased not to shed tears till morning dawned, whereupon Taj al-Muluk rose and went to farewell his mother, in travelling dress. She asked him of his case and he repeated the story to her; so she gave him fifty thousand gold pieces and bade him adieu; and, as he fared forth, she put up prayers for his safety and for his union with his lover and his friends. Then he betook himself to his father and asked his leave to depart. The King granted him permission and, presenting him with other fifty thousand dinars, bade set up a tent for him without the city and they pitched a pavilion wherein the travellers abode two days. Then all set out on their journey. Now Taj al-Muluk delighted in the company of Aziz and said to him, ""O my brother, henceforth I can never part from thee."" Replied Aziz, ""And I am of like mind and fain would I die under thy feet: but, O my brother, my heart is concerned for my mother."" ""When we shall have won our wish,"" said the Prince, ""there will be naught save what is well!"" Now the Wazir continued charging Taj al-Muluk to be patient, whilst Aziz entertained him every evening with talk and recited poetry to him and diverted him with histories and anecdotes. And so they fared on diligently night and day for two whole months, till the way became tedious to Taj al-Muluk and the fire of desire redoubled on him; and he broke out, / ""The road is lonesome; grow my grief and need, * While on my /          breast love fires for ever feed: / Goal of my hopes, sole object of my wish! * By him who moulded /          man from drop o' seed, / I bear such loads of longing for thy love, * Dearest, as weight /          of al Shumm Mounts exceed: / O 'Lady of my World'[FN#12] Love does me die; * No breath of life /          is left for life to plead; / But for the union hope that lends me strength, * My weary limbs /          were weak this way to speed.""When he had finished his verses, he wept (and Aziz wept with him) from a wounded heart, till the Minister was moved to pity by their tears and said, ""O my lord, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes clear of tears; there will be naught save what is well!"" Quoth Taj al-Muluk, ""O Wazir, indeed I am weary of the length of the way. Tell me how far we are yet distant from the city."" Quoth Aziz, ""But a little way remaineth to us."" Then they continued their journey, cutting across river vales and plains, words and stony wastes, till one night, as Taj al-Muluk was sleeping, he dreamt that his beloved was with him and that he embraced her and pressed her to his bosom; and he awoke quivering, shivering with pain, delirious with emotion, and improvised these verses, / ""Dear friend, my tears aye flow these cheeks adown, * /          With longsome pain and pine, my sorrow's crown: / I plain like keening woman child bereft, * /          And as night falls like widow dove I groan: / An blow the breeze from land where thou cost wone, * /          I find o'er sunburnt earth sweet coolness blown. / Peace be wi' thee, my love, while zephyr breathes, * /          And cushat flies and turtle makes her moan."" / And when he had ended his versifying, the Wazir came to him and said, ""Rejoice; this is a good sign: so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for thou shalt surely compass thy desire."" And Aziz also came to him and exhorted him to patience and applied himself to divert him, talking with him and telling him tales. So they pressed on, marching day and night, other two months, till there appeared to them one day at sunrise some white thing in the distance and Taj al-Muluk said to Aziz, ""What is yonder whiteness?"" He replied, ""O my lord! yonder is the Castle of Crystal and that is the city thou seekest."" At this the Prince rejoiced, and they ceased not faring forwards till they drew near the city and, as they approached it, Taj al-Muluk joyed with exceeding joy, and his care ceased from him. They entered in trader guise, the King's son being habited as a merchant of importance; and repaired to a great Khan, known as the Merchants' Lodging. Quoth Taj al-Muluk to Aziz, ""Is this the resort of the merchants?""; and quoth he, ""Yes; 'tis the Khan wherein I lodged before."" So they alighted there and making their baggage camels kneel, unloaded them and stored their goods in the warehouses.[FN#13] They abode four days for rest; when the Wazir advised that they should hire a large house. To this they assented and they found them a spacious house, fitted up for festivities, where they took up their abode, and the Wazir and Aziz studied to devise some device for Taj al-Muluk, who remained in a state of perplexity, knowing not what to do. Now the Minister could think of nothing but that he should set up as a merchant on 'Change and in the market of fine stuffs; so he turned to the Prince and his companion and said to them, ""Know ye that if we tarry here on this wise, assuredly we shall not win our wish nor attain our aim; but a something occurred to me whereby (if Allah please!) we shall find our advantage."" Replied Taj al-Muluk and Aziz, ""Do what seemeth good to thee, indeed there is a blessing on the grey beard; more specially on those who, like thyself, are conversant with the conduct of affairs: so tell us what occurreth to thy mind."" Rejoined the Wazir ""It is my counsel that we hire thee a shop in the stuff bazar, where thou mayst sit to sell and buy. Every one, great and small, hath need of silken stuffs and other cloths; so if thou patiently abide in thy shop, thine affairs will prosper, Inshallah! more by token as thou art comely of aspect. Make, however, Aziz thy factor and set him within the shop, to hand thee the pieces of cloth and stuffs."" When Taj al-Muluk heard these words, he said, 'This rede is right and a right pleasant recking."" So he took out a handsome suit of merchant's weed, and, putting it on, set out for the bazar, followed by his servants, to one of whom he had given a thousand dinars, wherewith to fit up the shop. They ceased not walking till they came to the stuff market, and when the merchants saw Taj al-Muluk's beauty and grace, they were confounded and went about saying, ""Of a truth Rizwán[FN#14] hath opened the gates of Paradise and left them unguarded, so that this youth of passing comeliness hath come forth."" And others, ""Peradventure this is one of the angels."" Now when they went in among the traders they asked for the shop of the Overseer of the market and the merchants directed them thereto. So they delayed not to repair thither and to salute him, and he and those who were with him rose to them and seated them and made much of them, because of the Wazir, whom they saw to be a man in years and of reverend aspect; and viewing the youths Aziz and Taj al-Muluk in his company, they said to one another, ""Doubtless our Shaykh is the father of these two youths."" Then quoth the Wazir, ""Who among you is the Overseer of the market?"" ""This is he,"" replied they; and behold, he came forward and the Wazir observed him narrowly and saw him to be an old man of grave and dignified carriage, with eunuchs and servants and black slaves. The Syndic greeted them with the greeting of friends and was lavish in his attentions to them: then he seated them by his side and asked them, ""Have ye any business which we[FN#15] may have the happiness of transacting?"" The Minister answered, ""Yes; I am an old man, stricken in years, and have with me these two youths, with whom I have travelled through every town and country, entering no great city without tarrying there a full year, that they might take their pleasure in viewing it and come to know its citizens. Now I have visited your town intending to sojourn here for a while; so I want of thee a handsome shop in the best situation, wherein I may establish them, that they may traffic and learn to buy and sell and give and take, whilst they divert themselves with the sight of the place, and be come familiar with the usages of its people."" Quoth the Overseer, ""There is no harm in that;"" and, looking at the two youths, he was delighted with them and affected them with a warm affection. Now he was a great connoisseur of bewitching glances, preferring the love of boys to that of girls and inclining to the sour rather than the sweet of love. So he said to himself, ""This, indeed, is fine game. Glory be to Him who created and fashioned them out of vile water!""[FN#16] and rising stood before them like a servant to do them honour. Then he went out and made ready for them a shop which was in the very midst of the Exchange; nor was there any larger or better in the bazar, for it was spacious and handsomely decorated and fitted with shelves of ivory and ebony wood. After this he delivered the keys to the Wazir, who was dressed as an old merchant, saying, ""Take them, O my lord, and Allah make it a blessed abiding place to thy two sons!"" The Minister took the keys and the three returning to the Khan where they had alighted, bade the servants transport to the shop all their goods and stuffs.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-second Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir took the shop keys, he went accompanied by Taj al-Muluk and Aziz to the Khan, and they bade the servants transport to the shop all their goods and stuffs and valuables of which they had great store worth treasures of money. And when all this was duly done, they went to the shop and ordered their stock in trade and slept there that night. As soon as morning morrowed the Wazir took the two young men to the Hammam bath where they washed them clean; and they donned rich dresses and scented themselves with essences and enjoyed themselves to the utmost. Now each of the youths was passing fair to look upon, and in the bath they were even as saith the poet, / ""Luck to the Rubber, whose deft hand o'erdies * /          A frame begotten twixt the lymph and light:[FN#17] / He shows the thaumaturgy of his craft, * /          And gathers musk in form of camphor dight.""[FN#18] / After bathing they left; and, when the Overseer heard that they had gone to the Hammam, he sat down to await the twain, and presently they came up to him like two gazelles; their cheeks were reddened by the bath and their eyes were darker than ever; their faces shone and they were as two lustrous moons or two branches fruit laden. Now when he saw them he rose forthright and said to them, ""O my sons, may your bath profit you always!""[FN#19] Where upon Taj al-Muluk replied, with the sweetest of speech, ""Allah be bountiful to thee, O my father; why didst thou not come with us and bathe in our company?"" Then they both bent over his right hand and kissed it and walked before him to the shop, to entreat him honourably and show their respect for him, for that he was Chief of the Merchants and the market, and he had done them kindness in giving them the shop. When he saw their hips quivering as they moved, desire and longing redoubled on him; and he puffed and snorted and he devoured them with his eyes, for he could not contain himself, repeating the while these two couplets, / ""Here the heart reads a chapter of devotion pure; * /          Nor reads dispute if Heaven in worship partner take: / No wonder 'tis he trembles walking 'neath such weight! * /          How much of movement that revolving sphere must /          make.[FN#20]"" / Furthermore he said, / ""I saw two charmers treading humble earth. * /          Two I must love an tread they on mine eyes."" / When they heard this, they conjured him to enter the bath with them a second time. He could hardly believe his ears and hastening thither, went in with them. The Wazir had not yet left the bath; so when he heard of the Overseer's coming, he came out and meeting him in the middle of the bath hall invited him to enter. He refused, whereupon Taj al-Muluk taking him by the hand walked on one side and Aziz by the other, and carried him into a cabinet; and that impure old man submitted to them, whilst his emotion increased on him. He would have refused, albeit this was what he desired; but the Minister said to him, ""They are thy sons; let them wash thee and cleanse thee."" ""Allah preserve them to thee!"" exclaimed the Overseer, ""By Allah your coming and the coming of those with you bring down blessing and good luck upon our city!"" And he repeated these two couplets, / ""Thou camest and green grew the hills anew; * /          And sweetest bloom to the bridegroom threw, / While aloud cried Earth and her earth-borns too * /          'Hail and welcome who comest with grace to endue.'"" / They thanked him for this, and Taj al-Muluk ceased not to wash him and to pour water over him and he thought his soul in Paradise. When they had made an end of his service, he blessed them and sat by the side of the Wazir, talking but gazing the while on the youths. Presently, the servants brought them towels, and they dried themselves and donned their dress. Then they went out, and the Minister turned to the Syndic and said to him, ""O my lord! verily the bath is the Paradise[FN#21] of this world."" Replied the Overseer, ""Allah vouchsafe to thee such Paradise, and health to thy sons and guard them from the evil eye! Do ye remember aught that the eloquent have said in praise of the bath.?"" Quoth Taj al-Muluk, ""I will repeat for thee a pair of couplets;"" and he recited, / The life of the bath is the joy of man's life,[FN#22] * /          Save that time is short for us there to bide: / A Heaven where irksome it were to stay; * /          A Hell, delightful at entering-tide."" / When he ended his recital, quoth Aziz, ""And I also remember two couplets in praise of the bath."" The Overseer said, ""Let me hear them,"" so he repeated the following, / ""A house where flowers from stones of granite grow, * /          Seen at its best when hot with living lows: / Thou deem'st it Hell but here, forsooth, is Heaven, * /          And some like suns and moons within it show."" / And when he had ended his recital, his verses pleased the Overseer and he wondered at his words and savoured their grace and fecundity and said to them, ""By Allah, ye possess both beauty and eloquence. But now listen to me, you twain!"" And he began chanting, and recited in song the following verses, / ""O joy of Hell and Heaven! whose tormentry * /          Enquickens frame and soul with lively gree: / I marvel so delightsome house to view, * /          And most when 'neath it kindled fires I see: / Sojourn of bliss to visitors, withal * /          Pools on them pour down tears unceasingly."" / Then his eye-sight roamed and browsed on the gardens of their beauty and he repeated these two couplets, / ""I went to the house of the keeper-man; * /          He was out, but others to smile began: / I entered his Heaven[FN#23] and then his Hell;[FN#24] * /          And I said 'Bless Málik[FN#25] and bless Rizwán.' ""[FN#26] / When they heard these verses they were charmed, and the Over seer invited them to his house; but they declined and returned to their own place, to rest from the great heat of the bath. So they took their ease there and ate and drank and passed that night in perfect solace and satisfaction, till morning dawned, when they arose from sleep and making their lesser ablution, prayed the dawn- prayer and drank the morning draught.[FN#27] As soon as the sun had risen and the shops and markets opened, they arose and going forth from their place to the bazar opened their shop, which their servants had already furnished, after the handsomest fashion, and had spread with prayer rugs and silken carpets and had placed on the divans a pair of mattresses, each worth an hundred dinars. On every mattress they had disposed a rug of skin fit for a King and edged with a fringe of gold; and a-middlemost the shop stood a third seat still richer, even as the place required. Then Taj al-Muluk sat down on one divan, and Aziz on another, whilst the Wazir seated himself on that in the centre, and the servants stood before them. The city people soon heard of them and crowded about them, so that they sold some of their goods and not a few of their stuffs; for Taj al-Muluk's beauty and loveliness had become the talk of the town. Thus they passed a trifle of time, and every day the people flocked to them and pressed upon them more and more, till the Wazir, after exhorting Taj al-Muluk to keep his secret, commended him to the care of Aziz and went home, that he might commune with himself alone and cast about for some contrivance which might profit them. Meanwhile, the two young men sat talking and Taj al-Muluk said to Aziz, ""Haply some one will come from the Lady Dunya."" So he ceased not expecting this chance days and nights, but his heart was troubled and he knew neither sleep nor rest; for desire had got the mastery of him, and love and longing were sore upon him, so that he renounced the solace of sleep and abstained from meat and drink; yet ceased he not to be like the moon on the night of fullness. Now one day as he sat in the shop, behold, there came up an ancient woman.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-third Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan: Now one day as Taj al-Muluk sat in his shop, behold, there appeared an ancient woman, who came up to him followed by two slave girls. She ceased not advancing till she stood before the shop of Taj al-Muluk and, observing his symmetry and beauty and loveliness, marvelled at his charms and sweated in her petticoat trousers, exclaiming, ""Glory to Him who created thee out of vile water, and made thee a temptation to all beholders!"" And she fixed her eyes on him and said, ""This is not a mortal, he is none other than an angel deserving the highest respect.""[FN#28] Then she drew near and saluted him, whereupon he returned her salute and rose to his feet to receive her and smiled in her face (all this by a hint from Aziz); after which he made her sit down by his side and fanned her with a fan, till she was rested and refreshed. Then she turned to Taj al-Muluk and said, ""O my son! O thou who art perfect in bodily gifts and spiritual graces; say me, art thou of this country?"" He replied, in voice the sweetest and in tone the pleasantest, ""By Allah, O my mistress, I was never in this land during my life till this time, nor do I abide here save by way of diversion."" Rejoined she, ""May the Granter grant thee all honour and prosperity! And what stuffs hast thou brought with thee? Show me something passing fine; for the beauteous should bring nothing but what is beautiful."" When he heard her words, his heart fluttered and he knew not their inner meaning; but Aziz made a sign to him and he replied, ""I have everything thou canst desire and especially I have goods that besit none but Kings and King's daughters; so tell me what stuff thou wantest and for whom, that I may show thee what will be fitting for him."" This he said, that he might learn the meaning of her words; and she rejoined, ""I want a stuff fit for the Princess Dunya, daughter of King Shahriman."" Now when the Prince heard the name of his beloved, he joyed with great joy and said to Aziz, ""Give me such a parcel."" So Aziz brought it and opened it before Taj al-Muluk who said to the old woman, ""Select what will suit her; for these goods are to be found only with me."" She chose stuffs worth a thousand dinars and asked, ""How much is this?""; and she ceased not the while to talk with him and rub what was inside her thighs with the palm of her hand. Answered Taj al-Muluk, ""Shall I haggle with the like of thee about this paltry price? Praised be Allah who hath acquainted me with thee!"" The old woman rejoined, ""Allah's name be upon thee! I commend thy beautiful face to the protection of the Lord of the Daybreak.[FN#29] Beautiful face and eloquent speech! Happy she who lieth in thy bosom and claspeth thy waist in her arms and enjoyeth thy youth, especially if she be beautiful and lovely like thyself!"" At this, Taj al-Muluk laughed till he fell on his back and said to himself, ""O Thou who fulfillest desires human by means of pimping old women! They are the true fulfillers of desires!"" Then she asked, ""O my son, what is thy name?"" and he answered, ""My name is Taj al-Muluk, the Crown of Kings."" Quoth she, ""This is indeed a name of Kings and King's sons and thou art clad in merchant's clothes."" Quoth Aziz, ""for the love his parents and family bore him and for the value they set on him, they named him thus."" Replied the old woman, ""Thou sayest sooth, Allah guard you both from the evil eye and the envious, though hearts be broken by your charms!"" Then she took the stuffs and went her way; but she was amazed at his beauty and stature and symmetry, and she ceased not going till she found the Lady Dunya and said to her, ""O my mistress! I have brought thee some handsome stuffs."" Quoth the Princess, ""Show me that same""; and the old woman, ""O apple of my eye, here it is, turn it over and examine it."" Now when the Princess looked at it she was amazed and said, ""O my nurse, this is indeed handsome stuff: I have never seen its like in our city."" ""O my lady,"" replied the old nurse, ""he who sold it me is handsomer still. It would seem as if Rizwan had left the gates of Paradise open in his carelessness, and as if the youth who sold me this stuff had come bodily out of Heaven. I would he might sleep this night with thee and might lie between thy breasts.[FN#30] He hath come to thy city with these precious stuffs for amusement's sake, and he is a temptation to all who set eyes on him."" The Princess laughed at her words and said, ""Allah afflict thee, O pernicious old hag! Thou dotest and there is no sense left in thee."" Presently, she resumed, ""Give me the stuff that I may look at it anew."" So she gave it her and she took it again and saw that its size was small and its value great. It pleased her, for she had never in her life seen its like, and she exclaimed, ""By Allah, this is a handsome stuff!"" Answered the old woman, ""O my lady, by Allah! if thou sawest its owner thou wouldst know him for the handsomest man on the face of the earth."" Quoth the Lady Dunya, ""Didst thou ask him if he had any need, that he might tell us and we might satisfy it?"" But the nurse shook her head and said, ""The Lord keep thy sagacity! By Allah, he hath a want, may thy skill not fail thee. What! is any man free from wants?"" Rejoined the Princess, ""Go back to him and salute him and say to him, 'Our land and town are honoured by thy visit and, if thou have any need, we will fulfil it to thee, on our head and eyes.' "" So the old woman at once returned to Taj al-Muluk, and when he saw her his heart jumped for joy and gladness and he rose to his feet before her and, taking her hand, seated her by his side. As soon as she was rested, she told him what Princess Dunya had said; and he on hearing it joyed with exceeding joy; his breast dilated to the full; gladness entered his heart and he said to himself, ""Verily, I have my need."" Then he asked the old woman, ""Haply thou wilt take her a message from me and bring me her answer?""; and she answered, ""I hear and I obey."" So he said to Aziz, ""Bring me ink-case and paper and a brazen pen."" And when Aziz brought him what he sought, he hent the pen in hand and wrote these lines of poetry, / ""I write to thee, O fondest hope! a writ * /          Of grief that severance on my soul cloth lay: / Saith its first line, 'Within my heart is [owe!' * /          Its second, 'Love and Longing on me prey!' / Its third, 'My patience waste is, fades my life!' * /          Its fourth, 'Naught shall my pain and pine allay!' / Its fifth, 'When shall mine eyes enjoy thy sight?' * /          Its sixth, 'Say, when shall dawn our meeting-day?' "" / And, lastly, by way of subscription he wrote these words. ""This letter is from the captive of captivation * prisoned in the hold of longing expectation * wherefrom is no emancipation * but in anticipation and intercourse and in unification * after absence and separation. * For from the severance of friends he loveth so fain * he suffereth love pangs and pining pain. *"" Then his tears rushed out, and he indited these two couplets, / ""I write thee, love, the while my tears pour down; * /          Nor cease they ever pouring thick and fleet: / Yet I despair not of my God, whose grace * /          Haply some day will grant us twain to meet."" / Then he folded the letter[FN#31] and sealed it with his signet ring and gave it to the old woman, saying, ""Carry it to the Lady Dunya."" Quoth she, ""To hear is to obey;"" whereupon he gave her a thousand dinars and said to her, ""O my mother! accept this gift from me as a token of my affection."" She took both from him and blessed him and went her way and never stinted walking till she went in to the Lady Dunya. Now when the Princess saw her she said to her, ""O my nurse, what is it he asketh of need that we may fulfil his wish to him?"" Replied the old woman, ""O my lady, he sendeth thee this letter by me, and I know not what is in it;"" and handed it to her. Then the Princess took the letter and read it; and when she understood it, she exclaimed, ""Whence cometh and whither goeth this merchant man that he durst address such a letter to me?"" And she slapt her face saying, ""'Whence are we that we should come to shopkeeping? Awah! Awah! By the lord, but that I fear Almighty Allah I had slain him;"" and she added, ""Yea, I had crucified[FN#32] him over his shop door!"" Asked the old woman, ""What is in this letter to vex thy heart and move thy wrath on this wise? Doth it contain a complaint of oppression or demand for the price of the stuff?"" Answered the Princess, ""Woe to thee! There is none of this in it, naught but words of love and endearment. This is all through thee: otherwise whence should this Satan[FN#33] know me?"" Rejoined the old woman, ""o my lady, thou sittest in thy high palace and none may have access to thee; no, not even the birds of the air. Allah keep thee, and keep thy youth from blame and reproach! Thou needest not care for the barking of dogs, for thou art a Princess, the daughter of a King. Be not wroth with me that I brought thee this letter, knowing not what was in it; but I opine that thou send him an answer and threaten him with death and forbid him this foolish talk; surely he will abstain and not do the like again."" Quoth the Lady Dunya, ""I fear that, if I write to him, he will desire me the more."" The old woman returned ""When he heareth thy threats and promise of punishment, he will desist from his persistence."" She cried, ""Here with the ink case and paper and brazen pen;"" and when they brought them she wrote these couplets, / ""O thou who for thy wakeful nights wouldst claim my love /          to boon, * For what of pining thou must feel and /          tribulation! / Dost thou, fond fool and proud of sprite, seek meeting with the /          Moon? * Say, did man ever win his wish to take in arms the /          Moon? / I counsel thee, from soul cast out the wish that dwells /          therein, * And cut that short which threatens thee with /          sore risk oversoon: / An to such talk thou dare return, I bid thee to expect * /          Fro' me such awful penalty as suiteth froward loon: / I swear by Him who moulded man from gout of clotted /          blood,[FN#34] * Who lit the Sun to shine by day and lit /          for night the moon, / An thou return to mention that thou spakest in thy pride, * /          Upon a cross of tree for boon I'll have thee crucified!"" / Then she folded the letter and handing it to the old woman said, ""Give him this and say him, 'Cease from this talk!' "" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied she, and taking the letter with joy, returned to her own house, where she passed the night; and when morning dawned she betook herself to the shop of Taj al-Muluk whom she found expecting her. When he saw her, he was ready to fly[FN#35] for delight, and when she came up to him, he stood to her on his feet and seated her by his side. Then she brought out the letter and gave it to him, saying, ""Read what is in this;"" adding ""When Princess Dunya read thy letter she was angry; but I coaxed her and jested with her till I made her laugh, and she had pity on thee and she hath returned thee an answer."" He thanked her for her kindness and bade Aziz give her a thousand gold pieces: then he perused the letter and understanding it fell to weeping a weeping so sore that the old woman's heart was moved to ruth for him, and his tears and complaints were grievous to her. Presently she asked him, ""O my son, what is there in this letter to make thee weep?"" Answered he, ""She hath threatened me with death and crucifixion and she forbiddeth me to write to her, but if I write not my death were better than my life. So take thou my answer to the letter and let her work her will."" Rejoined the old woman, ""By the life of thy youth, needs must I risk my existence for thee, that I may bring thee to thy desire and help thee to win what thou hast at heart!"" And Taj al-Muluk said, ""Whatever thou dost, I will requite thee for it and do thou weigh it in the scales of thy judgement, for thou art experienced in managing matters, and skilled in reading the chapters of the book of intrigue: all hard matters to thee are easy doings; and Allah can bring about everything."" Then he took a sheet of paper and wrote thereon these improvised couplets, / ""Yestre'en my love with slaughter menaced me, * /          But sweet were slaughter and Death's foreordainèd: / Yes, Death is sweet for lover doomed to bear * /          Long life, rejected, injured and constrainèd: / By Allah! deign to visit friendless friend! * /          Thy thrall am I and like a thrall I'm chainèd: / Mercy, O lady mine, for loving thee! * /          Who loveth noble soul should be assainèd."" / Then he sighed heavy sighs and wept till the old woman wept also and presently taking the letter she said to him, ""Be of good cheer and cool eyes and clear; for needs must I bring thee to thy wish.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Taj al-Muluk wept the old woman said to him, ""Be of good cheer and cool eyes and clear; for needs must I bring thee to thy wish."" Then she rose and left him on coals of fire; and returned to Princess Dunya, whom she found still showing on her changed face rage at Taj al-Muluk's letter. So she gave her his second letter, whereat her wrath redoubled and she said, ""Did I not say he would desire us the more?"" Replied the old woman, ""What thing is this dog that he should aspire to thee?"" Quoth the Princess, ""Go back to him and tell him that, if he write me after this, I will cut off his head."" Quoth the nurse, ""Write these words in a letter and I will take it to him that his fear may be the greater."" So she took a sheet of paper and wrote thereon these couplets, / ""Ho thou, who past and bygone risks regardest with uncare! * /          Thou who to win thy meeting prize dost overslowly fare! / In pride of spirit thinkest thou to win the star Soha[FN#36]? * /          Albe thou may not reach the Moon which shines through /          upper air? / How darest thou expect to win my favours, hope to clip * /          Upon a lover's burning breast my lance like shape and rare? / Leave this thy purpose lest my wrath come down on thee some /          day, * A day of wrath shall hoary turn the partings of /          thy hair!"" / Then she folded the letter and gave it to the old woman, who took it and repaired to Taj al-Muluk. And when he saw her, he rose to his feet and exclaimed, ""May Allah never bereave me of the blessing of thy coming!"" Quoth she, ""Take the answer to thy letter."" He took it and reading it, wept with sore weeping and said, ""I long for some one to slay me at this moment and send me to my rest, for indeed death were easier to me than this my state!"" Then he took ink case and pen and paper and wrote a letter containing these two couplets, / ""O hope of me! pursue me not with rigour and disdain: * /          Deign thou to visit lover wight in love of thee is drowned; / Deem not a life so deeply wronged I longer will endure; * My soul /          for severance from my friend divorced this frame unsound."" / Lastly he folded the letter and handed it to the old woman, saying, ""Be not angry with me, though I have wearied thee to no purpose."" And he bade Aziz give her other thousand ducats, saying, ""O my mother, needs must this letter result in perfect union or utter severance."" Replied she, ""O my son, by Allah, I desire nought but thy weal; and it is my object that she be thine, for indeed thou art the shining moon, and she the rising sun.[FN#37] If I do not bring you together, there is no profit in my existence; and I have lived my life till I have reached the age of ninety years in the practice of wile and intrigue; so how should I fail to unite two lovers, though in defiance of right and law?"" Then she took leave of him having comforted his heart, and ceased not walking till she went in to the Lady Dunya. Now she had hidden the letter in her hair: so when she sat down by the Princess she rubbed her head and said, ""O my lady, maybe thou wilt untwist my hair knot, for it is a time since I went to the Hammam."" The King's daughter bared her arms to the elbows and, letting down the old woman's locks, began to loose the knot of back hair; when out dropped the letter and the Lady Dunya seeing it, asked, ""What is this paper?"" Quoth the nurse, ""As I sat in the merchant's shop, this paper must have stuck to me: give it to me that I may return it to him; possibly it containeth some account whereof he hath need."" But the Princess opened it and read it and, when she understood it, she cried out, ""This is one of thy manifold tricks, and hadst thou not reared me, I would lay violent hands on thee this moment! Verily Allah hath afflicted me with this merchant: but all that hath befallen me with him is on thy head. I know not from what country this one can have come: no man but he would venture to affront me thus, and I fear lest this my case get abroad, more by token as it concerneth one who is neither of my kin nor of my peers."" Rejoined the old woman ""None would dare speak of this for fear of thy wrath and for awe of thy sire; so there can be no harm in sending him an answer."" Quoth the Princess, ""O my nurse, verily this one is a perfect Satan! How durst he use such language to me and not dread the Sultan's rage. Indeed, I am perplexed about his case: if I order him to be put to death, it were unjust; and if I leave him alive his boldness will increase."" Quoth the old woman, ""Come, write him a letter; it may be he will desist in dread."" So she called for paper and ink case and pen and wrote these couplets, / ""Thy folly drives thee on though long I chid, * /          Writing in verse: how long shall I forbid? / For all forbiddal thou persistest more, * /          And my sole grace it is to keep it hid; / Then hide thy love nor ever dare reveal, * /          For an thou speak, of thee I'll soon be rid / If to thy silly speech thou turn anew, * /          Ravens shall croak for thee the wold amid: / And Death shall come and beat thee down ere long, * /          Put out of sight and bury 'neath an earthen lid: / Thy folk, fond fool! thou'lt leave for thee to mourn, * /          And through their lives to sorrow all forlorn."" / Then she folded the letter and committed it to the old woman, who took it and returning to Taj al-Muluk, gave it to him. When he read it, he knew that the Princess was hard hearted and that he should not win access to her; so he complained of his case to the Wazir and besought his counsel. Quoth the Minister, ""Know thou that naught will profit thee save that thou write to her and invoke the retribution of Heaven upon her."" And quoth the Prince, ""O my brother, O Aziz, do thou write to her as if my tongue spake, according to thy knowledge."" So Aziz took a paper and wrote these couplets, / ""By the Five Shaykhs,[FN#38] O Lord, I pray deliver me; * /          Let her for whom I suffer bear like misery: / Thou knowest how I fry in flaming lowe of love, * /          While she I love hath naught of ruth or clemency: / How long shall I, despite my pain, her feelings spare? * /          How long shall she wreak tyranny o'er weakling me? / In pains of never ceasing death I ever grieve: * /          O Lord, deign aid; none other helping hand I see. / How fain would I forget her and forget her love! * /          But how forget when Love garred Patience death to dree? / O thou who hinderest Love to 'joy fair meeting tide * /          Say! art thou safe from Time and Fortune's jealousy? / Art thou not glad and blest with happy life, while I * /          From folk and country for thy love am doomed flee?"" / Then Aziz folded the letter and gave it to Taj al-Muluk, who read it and was pleased with it. So he handed it to the old woman, who took it and went in with it to Princess Dunya. But when she read it and mastered the meaning thereof, she was enraged with great rage and said, ""All that hath befallen me cometh by means of this ill omened old woman!"" Then she cried out to the damsels and eunuchs, saying, ""Seize this old hag, this accursed trickstress and beat her with your slippers!"" So they came down upon her till she swooned away; and, when she came to herself, the Princess said to her, ""By the Lord! O wicked old woman, did I not fear Almighty Allah, I would slay thee."" Then quoth she to them, ""Beat her again"" and they did so till she fainted a second time, whereupon she bade them drag her forth and throw her outside the palace door. So they dragged her along on her face and threw her down before the gate; but as soon as she revived she got up from the ground and, walking and sitting by turns, made her way home. There she passed the night till morning, when she arose and went to Taj al-Muluk and told them all that had occurred. He was distressed at this grievous news and said, ""O my mother, hard indeed to us is that which hath befallen thee, but all things are according to fate and man's lot."" Replied she, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I will not give over striving till I have brought thee and her together, and made thee enjoy this wanton who hath burnt my skin with beating."" Asked the Prince ""Tell me what caused her to hate men;"" and the old woman answered, ""It arose from what she saw in a dream."" ""And what was this dream?"" ""'Twas this: one night, as she lay asleep, she saw a fowler spread his net upon the ground and scatter wheat grain round it. Then he sat down hard by, and not a bird in the neighbourhood but flocked to his toils. Amongst the rest she beheld a pair of pigeons, male and female; and, whilst she was watching the net, behold, the male bird's foot caught in the meshes and he began to struggle; whereupon all the other birds took fright and flew away. But presently his mate came back and hovered over him, then alighted on the toils unobserved by the fowler, and fell to pecking with her beak and pulling at the mesh in which the male bird's foot was tangled, till she released the toes and they flew away together. Then the fowler came up, mended his net and seated himself afar off. After an hour or so the birds flew back and the female pigeon was caught in the net; whereupon all the other birds took fright and scurried away; and the male pigeon fled with the rest and did not return to his mate, but the fowler came up and took the female pigeon and cut her throat. The Princess awoke, troubled by her dream, and said, 'All males are like this pigeon, worthless creatures: and men in general lack grace and goodness to women.'"" When the old woman had ended her story, the Prince said to her, ""O my mother, I desire to have one look at her, though it be my death; so do thou contrive me some contrivance for seeing her."" She replied, ""Know then that she hath under her palace windows a garden wherein she taketh her pleasure; and thither she resorteth once in every month by the private door. After ten days, the time of her thus going forth to divert herself will arrive; so when she is about to visit the garden, I will come and tell thee, that thou mayst go thither and meet her. And look thou leave not the garden, for haply, an she see thy beauty and Loveliness, her heart will be taken with love of thee, and love is the most potent means of union."" He said, ""I hear and obey;"" whereupon he and Aziz arose and left the shop and, taking the old woman with them, showed her the place where they lodged. Then said Taj al- Muluk to Aziz, ""O my brother, I have no need of the shop now, having fulfilled my purpose of it; so I give it to thee with all that is in it; for that thou hast come abroad with me and hast left thy native land for my sake."" Aziz accepted his gift and then they sat conversing, while the Prince questioned him of the strange adventures which had befallen him, and his companion acquainted him with the particulars thereof. Presently, they went to the Wazir and, reporting to him Taj al-Muluk's purpose, asked him, ""What is to be done?"" ""Let us go to the garden,"" answered he. So each and every donned richest clothes and went forth, followed by three white slaves to the garden, which they found thick with thickets and railing its rills. When they saw the keeper sitting at the gate, they saluted him with the Salam and he returned their salute. Then the Wazir gave him an hundred gold pieces, saying, ""Prithee, take this small sum and fetch us somewhat to eat; for we are strangers and I have with me these two lads whom I wish to divert.""[FN#39] The Gardener took the sequins and said to them, ""Enter and amuse yourselves in the garden, for it is all yours; and sit down till I bring you what food you require."" So he went to the market while the Wazir and Taj al-Muluk and Aziz entered the garden. And shortly after leaving for the bazar the Gardener returned with a roasted lamb and cotton white bread, which he placed before them, and they ate and drank; thereupon he served up sweetmeats, and they ate of them, and washed their hands and sat talking. Presently the Wazir said to the garth keeper, ""Tell me about this garden: is it thine or dost thou rent it?"" The Shaykh replied, ""It doth not belong to me, but to our King's daughter, the Princess Dunya."" ""What be thy monthly wages?"" asked the Wazir and he answered, ""One diner and no more."" Then the Minister looked round about the garden and, seeing in its midst a pavilion tall and grand but old and disused, said to the keeper, ""O elder, I am minded to do here a good work, by which thou shalt remember me. Replied the other, ""O my lord, what is the good work thou wouldest do?"" ""Take these three hundred diners,"" rejoined the Wazir When the Keeper heard speak of the gold, he said, ""O my lord, whatso thou wilt, do!"" So the Wazir gave him the monies, saying, ""Inshallah, we will make a good work in this place!"" Then they left him and returned to their lodging, where they passed the night; and when it was the next day, the Minister sent for a plasterer and a painter and a skilful goldsmith and, furnishing them with all the tools they wanted, carried them to the garden, where he bade them whitewash the walls of the pavilion and decorate it with various kinds of paintings. Moreover he sent for gold and lapis lazuli[FN#40] and said to the painter, ""Figure me on the wall, at the upper end of this hall, a man fowler with his nets spread and birds falling into them and a female pigeon entangled in the meshes by her bill."" And when the painter had finished his picture on one side, the Wazir said, ""Figure me on the other side a similar figure and represent the she pigeon alone in the snare and the fowler seizing her and setting the knife to her neck; and draw on the third side wall, a great raptor clutching the male pigeon, her mate, and digging talons into him."" The artist did his bidding, and when he and the others had finished the designs, they received their hire and went away. Then the Wazir and his companions took leave of the Gardener and returned to their place, where they sat down to converse. And Taj al-Muluk said to Aziz, ""O my brother, recite me some verses: perchance it may broaden my breast and dispel my dolours and quench the fire flaming in my heart."" So Aziz chanted with sweet modulation these couplets, / ""Whate'er they say of grief to lovers came, * /          I, weakling I, can single handed claim: / An seek thou watering spot,[FN#41] my streaming eyes * /          Pour floods that thirst would quench howe'er it flame / Or wouldest view what ruin Love has wrought * /          With ruthless hands, then see this wasted frame."" / And his eyes ran over with tears and he repeated these couplets also, / ""Who loves not swan-neck and gazelle-like eyes, * /          Yet claims to know Life's joys, I say he lies: / In Love is mystery, none avail to learn * /          Save he who loveth in pure loving wise. / Allah my heart ne'er lighten of this love, * /          Nor rob the wakefulness these eyelids prize."" / Then he changed the mode of song and sang these couplets: / ""Ibn Síná[FN#42] in his Canon cloth opine * /          Lovers' best cure is found in merry song: / In meeting lover of a like degree, * /          Dessert in garden, wine draughts long and strong: / I chose another who of thee might cure * /          While Force and Fortune aided well and long / But ah! I learnt Love's mortal ill, wherein * /          Ibn Sina's recipe is fond and wrong."" / After hearing them to the end, Taj al-Muluk was pleased with his verses and wondered at his eloquence and the excellence of his recitation, saying, ""Indeed, thou hast done away with somewhat of my sorrow."" Then quoth the Wazir ""Of a truth, there occurred to those of old what astoundeth those who hear it told."" Quoth the Prince, ""If thou canst recall aught of this kind, prithee let us hear thy subtle lines and keep up the talk."" So the Minister chanted in modulated song these couplets, / ""Indeed I deemed thy favours might be bought * /          By gifts of gold and things that joy the sprite / And ignorantly thought thee light-o'-love, * /          When can thy love lay low the highmost might; / Until I saw thee choosing one, that one * /          Loved with all favour, crowned with all delight: / Then wot I thou by sleight canst ne'er be won * /          And under wing my head I hid from sight / And in this nest of passion made my wone, * /          Wherein I nestle morning, noon and night."" / So far concerning them; but as regards the old woman she remained shut up from the world in her house, till it befel that the King's daughter was taken with a desire to divert herself in the garden. Now she had never been won't so to do save in company with her nurse; accordingly she sent for her and made friends with her and soothed her sorrow, saying, ""I wish to go forth to the garden, that I may divert myself with the sight of its trees and Fruits, and broaden my breast with the scent of its flowers."" Replied the old woman, ""I hear and obey; but first I would go to my house, and soon I will be with thee."" The Princess rejoined, ""Go home, but be not long absent from me."" So the old woman left her and, repairing to Taj al-Muluk, said to him, ""Get thee ready and don thy richest dress and go to the garden and find out the Gardener and salute him and then hide thyself therein."" ""To hear is to obey"" answered he; and she agreed with him upon a signal, after which she returned to the Lady Dunya. As soon as she was gone, the Wazir and Aziz rose and robed Taj al-Muluk in a splendid suit of royal raiment worth five thousand diners, and girt his middle with a girdle of gold set with gems and precious metals. Then they repaired to the garden and found seated at the gate the Keeper who, as soon as he saw the Prince, sprang to his feet and received him with all respect and reverence, and opening the gate, said, ""Enter and take thy pleasure in looking at the garden."" Now the Gardener knew not that the King's daughter was to visit the place that day; but when Taj al-Muluk had been a little while there, he heard a hubbub and ere he could think, out issued the eunuchs and damsels by the private wicket. The Gardener seeing this came up to the Prince, informed him of her approach and said to him, ""O my lord, what is to be done? The Princess Dunya, the King's daughter, is here."" Replied the Prince, ""Fear not, no harm shall befal thee; for I will hide me somewhere about the garden."" So the Keeper exhorted him to the utmost prudence and went away. Presently the Princess entered the garden with her damsels and with the old woman, who said to herself, ""If these eunuchs stay with us, we shall not attain our end."" So quoth she to the King's daughter, ""O my lady, I have somewhat to tell thee which shall ease thy heart."" Quoth the Princess, ""Say what thou hast to say."" ""O my lady, rejoined the old woman, ""thou hast no need of these eunuchs at a time like the present; nor wilt thou be able to divert thyself at thine ease, whilst they are with us; so send them away;"" and the Lady Dunya replied, ""Thou speakest sooth"" Accordingly she dismissed them and presently began to walk about, whilst Taj al-Muluk looked upon her and fed his eyes on her beauty and loveliness (but she knew it not); and every time he gazed at her he fainted by reason of her passing charms.[FN#43] The old woman drew her on by converse till they reached the pavilion which the Wazir had bidden be decorated, when the Princess entered and cast a glance round and perceived the picture of the birds the fowler and the pigeon; whereupon she cried, ""Exalted be Allah! This is the very counterfeit presentment of what I saw in my dream."" She continued to gaze at the figures of the birds and the fowler with his net, admiring the work, and presently she said, ""O my nurse, I have been won't to blame and hate men, but look now at the fowler how he hath slaughtered the she bird who set free her mate; who was minded to return to her and aid her to escape when the bird of prey met him and tore him to pieces."" Now the old woman feigned ignorance to her and ceased not to occupy her in converse, till they drew near the place where Taj al-Muluk lay hidden. Thereupon she signed to him to come out and walk under the windows of the pavilion, and, as the Lady Dunya stood looking from the casement, behold, her glance fell that way and she saw him and noting his beauty of face and form, said to the old woman, ""O my nurse, whence cometh yonder handsome youth?"" Replied the old woman, ""I know nothing of him save that I think he must be some great King's son, for he attaineth comeliness in excess and extreme loveliness."" And the Lady Dunya fell in love with him to distraction; the spells which bound her were loosed and her reason was overcome by his beauty and grace; and his fine stature and proportions strongly excited her desires sexual. So she said, ""O my nurse! this is indeed a handsome youth;"" and the old woman replied, ""Thou sayest sooth, O my lady,"" and signed to Taj al-Muluk to go home. And though desire and longing flamed in him and he was distraught for love, yet he went away and took leave of the Gardener and returned to his place, obeying the old woman and not daring to cross her. When he told the Wazir and Aziz that she had signed him to depart, they exhorted him to patience, saying, ""Did not the ancient dame know that there was an object to be gained by thy departure, she had not signalled thee to return home."" Such was the case with Taj al-Muluk, the Wazir and Aziz but as regards the King's daughter, the Lady Dunya, desire and passion redoubled upon her; she was overcome with love and longing and she said to her nurse, ""I know not how I shall manage a meeting with this youth, but through thee."" Exclaimed the old woman, ""I take refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned! Thou who art averse from men! How cometh it then that thou art thus afflicted with hope and fear of this young man? Yet, by Allah, none is worthy of thy youth but he."" Quoth the Lady Dunya, ""O my nurse, further my cause and help me to foregather with him, and thou shalt have of me a thousand diners and a dress of honour worth as much more: but if thou aid me not to come at him, I am a dead woman in very sooth."" Replied the ancient dame, ""Go to thy palace and leave me to devise means for bringing you twain together. I will throw away my life to content you both!"" So the Lady Dunya returned to her palace, and the old woman betook herself to Taj al-Muluk who, when he saw her, rose to receive her and entreated her with respect and reverence making her sit by his side. Then she said, ""The trick hath succeeded,"" and told him all that had passed between herself and the Princess. He asked her, ""When is our meeting to be?""; and she answered, ""Tomorrow."" So he gave her a thousand diners and a dress of like value, and she took them and stinted not walking till she returned to her mistress, who said to her, ""O my nurse! what news of the be loved?"" Replied she, ""I have learnt where he liveth and will bring him to thee tomorrow."" At this the Princess was glad and gave her a thousand diners and a dress worth as much more, and she took them and returned to her own place, where she passed the night till morning. Then she went to Taj al-Muluk and dressing him in woman's clothes, said to him, ""Follow me and sway from side to side[FN#44] as thou steppest, and hasten not thy pace nor take heed of any who speaketh to thee."" And after thus charging him she went out, and the Prince followed her in woman's attire and she continued to charge and encourage him by the way, that he might not be afraid; nor ceased they walking till they came to the Palace-gate. She entered and the Prince after her, and she led him on, passing through doors and vestibules, till they had passed seven doors.[FN#45] As they approached the seventh, she said to him, ""Hearten thy heart and when I call out to thee and say, 'O damsel pass on!' do not slacken thy pace, but advance as if about to run. When thou art in the vestibule, look to thy left and thou wilt see a saloon with doors: count five doors and enter the sixth, for therein is thy desire."" Asked Taj al-Muluk, ""And whither wilt thou go?""; and she answered, ""Nowhere shall I go except that perhaps I may drop behind thee, and the Chief Eunuch may detain me to chat with him."" She walked on (and he behind her) till she reached the door where the Chief Eunuch was stationed and he, seeing Taj al-Muluk with her dressed as a slave girl, said to the old woman, ""What business hath this girl with thee?"" Replied she, ""This is a slave girl of whom the Lady Dunya hath heard that she is skilled in different kinds of work and she hath a mind to buy her."" Rejoined the Eunuch, ""I know neither slave girls nor anyone else; and none shall enter here without my searching according to the King's commands.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Chamberlain Eunuch cried to the old woman, ""I know neither slave girl nor anyone else; and none shall enter here without my searching him according to the King's commands."" Then quoth she, feigning to be angry, ""I thought thee a man of sense and good breeding; but, if thou be changed, I will let the Princess know of it and tell her how thou hinderest her slave girl;"" and she cried out to Taj al-Muluk, saying, ""Pass on, O damsel!"" So he passed on into the vestibule as she bade him, whilst the Eunuch was silent and said no more. The Prince counted five doors and entered the sixth where he found the Princess Dunya standing and awaiting him. As soon as she saw him, she knew him and clasped him to her breast, and he clasped her to his bosom. Presently the old woman came in to them, having made a pretext to dismiss the Princess's slave girls for fear of disgrace; and the Lady Dunya said to her, ""Be thou our door keeper!"" So she and Taj al- Muluk abode alone together and ceased not kissing and embracing and twining leg with leg till dawn.[FN#46] When day drew near, she left him and, shutting the door upon him, passed into another chamber, where she sat down as was her won't, whilst her slave women came in to her, and she attended to their affairs and conversed with them. Then she said to them, ""Go forth from me now, for I wish to amuse myself in privacy."" So they withdrew and she betook herself to Taj al-Muluk, and the old woman brought them food, of which they ate and returned to amorous dalliance till dawn. Then the door was locked upon him as on the day before; and they ceased not to do thus for a whole month. This is how it fared with Taj al-Muluk and the Lady Dunya; but as regards the Wazir and Aziz when they found that the Prince had gone to the Palace of the King's daughter and there delayed all the while, they concluded that he would never return from it and that he was lost for ever; and Aziz said to the Wazir, ""O my father, what shall we do?"" He replied, ""O my son, this is a difficult matter, and except we return to his sire and tell him, he will blame us therefor."" So they made ready at once and forthright set out for the Green Land and the Country of the Two Columns, and sought Sulayman Shah's capital. And they traversed the valleys night and day till they went in to the King, and acquainted him with what had befallen his son and how from the time he entered the Princess's Palace they had heard no news of him. At this the King was as though the Day of Doom had dawned for him and regret was sore upon him, and he proclaimed a Holy War[FN#47] throughout his realm. After which he sent forth his host without the town and pitched tents for them and took up his abode in his pavilion, whilst the levies came from all parts of the kingdom; for his subjects loved him by reason of his great justice and beneficence. Then he marched with an army walling the horizon, and departed in quest of his son. Thus far concerning them; but as regards Taj al-Muluk and the Lady Dunya the two remained as they were half a year's time, whilst every day they redoubled in mutual affection; and love and longing and passion and desire so pressed upon Taj al Muluk, that at last he opened his mind and said to her, ""Know, O beloved of my heart and vitals, that the longer I abide with thee, the more love and longing and passion and desire increase on me, for that I have not yet fulfilled the whole of my wish."" Asked she, ""What then wouldst thou have, O light of my eyes and fruit of my vitals? If thou desire aught beside kissing and embracing and entwining of legs with legs, do what pleaseth thee; for, by Allah, no partner hath any part in us.""[FN#48] But he answered ""It is not that I wish: I would fain acquaint thee with my true story. Know, then, that I am no merchant, nay, I am a King the son of a King, and my father's name is the supreme King Sulayman Shah, who sent his Wazir ambassador to thy father, to demand thee in marriage for me, but when the news came to thee thou wouldst not consent."" Then he told her his past from first to last, nor is there any avail in a twice told tale, and he added, ""And now I wish to return to my father, that he may send an ambassador to thy sire, to demand thee in wedlock for me, so we may be at ease."" When she heard these words, she joyed with great joy because it suited with her own wishes, and they passed the night on this understanding. But it so befel by the decree of Destiny that sleep overcame them that night above all nights and they remained till the sun had risen. Now at this hour, King Shahriman was sitting on his cushion of estate, with his Emirs and Grandees before him, when the Syndic of the goldsmiths presented himself between his hands, carrying a large box. And he advanced and opening it in presence of the King, brought out therefrom a casket of fine work worth an hundred thousand diners, for that which was therein of precious stones, rubies and emeralds beyond the competence of any sovereign on earth to procure. When the King saw this, he marvelled at its beauty; and, turning to the Chief Eunuch (him with whom the old woman had had to do), said to him, ""O Kafur,[FN#49] take this casket and wend with it to the Princess Dunya."" The Castrato took the casket and repairing to the apartment of the King's daughter found the door shut and the old woman lying asleep on the threshold; whereupon said he, ""What! sleeping at this hour?"" When the old woman heard the Eunuch's voice she started from sleep and was terrified and said to him, ""Wait till I fetch the key."" Then she went forth and fled for her life. Such was her case; but as regards the Epicene he, seeing her alarm, lifted the door off its hinge pins,[FN#50] and entering found the Lady Dunya with her arms round the neck of Taj al-Muluk and both fast asleep. At this sight he was confounded and was preparing to return to the King, when the Princess awoke, and seeing him, was terrified and changed colour and waxed pale, and said to him, ""O Kafur, veil thou what Allah hath veiled!""[FN#51] But he replied, ""I cannot conceal aught from the King""; and, locking the door on them, returned to Shahriman, who asked him, ""Hast thou given the casket to the Princess?"" Answered the Eunuch, ""Take the casket, here it is for I cannot conceal aught from thee. Know that I found a handsome young man by the side of the Princess and they two asleep in one bed and in mutual embrace."" The King commanded them to be brought into the presence and said to them, ""What manner of thing is this?"" and, being violently enraged, seized a dagger and was about to strike Taj al-Muluk with it, when the Lady Dunya threw herself upon him and said to her father, ""Slay me before thou slayest him."" The King reviled her and commended her to be taken back to her chamber: then he turned to Taj al-Muluk and said to him, ""Woe to thee! whence art thou? Who is thy father and what hath emboldened thee to debauch my daughter?"" Replied the Prince, ""Know, O King, that if thou put me to death, thou art a lost man, and thou and all in thy dominions will repent the deed."" Quoth the King, ""How so?""; and quoth Taj al-Muluk ""Know that I am the son of King Sulayman Shah, and ere thou knowest it, he will be upon thee with his horse and foot."" When King Shahriman heard these words he would have deferred killing Taj al-Muluk and would rather have put him in prison, till he should look into the truth of his words; but his Wazir said to him, ""O King of the Age, it is my opinion that thou make haste to slay this gallows bird who dares debauch the daughters of Kings."" So the King cried to the headsman, ""Strike off his head; for he is a traitor."" Accordingly, the herdsman took him and bound him fast and raised his hand to the Emirs, signing to consult them, a first and a second signal, thinking thereby to gain time in this matter;[FN#52] but the King cried in anger to him, ""How long wilt thou consult others? If thou consult them again I will strike off thine own head.;' So the headsman raised his hand till the hair of his armpit showed' and was about to smite his neck,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the headsman raised his hand to smite off his head when behold, loud cries arose and the folk closed their shops; whereupon the King said to the headsman, ""Wait awhile,"" and despatched one to learn the news. The messenger fared forth and presently returned and reported, ""I saw an army like the dashing sea with its clashing surge: and their horses curvetting till earth trembleth with the tramp; and I know no more of them."" When the King heard this, he was confounded and feared for his realm lest it should be torn from him; so he turned to his Minister and said, ""Have not any of our army gone forth to meet this army?"" But ere he had done speaking, his Chamberlains entered with messengers from the King who was approaching, and amongst them the Wazir who had accompanied Taj al-Muluk. They began by saluting the King, who rose to receive them and bade them draw near, and asked the cause of their coming; whereupon the Minister came forward from amongst them and stood before him and said ""Know that he who hath come down upon thy realm is no King like unto the Kings of yore and the Sultans that went before."" ""And who is he?"" asked Shahriman, and the Wazir answered, ""He is the Lord of justice and loyalty, the bruit of whose magnanimity the caravans have blazed abroad, the Sultan Sulayman Shah, Lord of the Green Land and the Two Columns and the Mountains of Ispahan; he who loveth justice and equity, and hateth oppression and iniquity. And he saith to thee that his son is with thee and in thy city; his son, his heart's very core and the fruit of his loins, and if he find him in safety, his aim is won and thou shalt have thanks and praise; but if he have been lost from thy realm or if aught of evil have befallen him, look thou for ruin and the wasting of thy reign! for this thy city shall become a wold wherein the raven shall croak. Thus have I done my errand to thee and peace be with thee!"" Now when King Shahriman heard from the messenger these words, his heart was troubled and he feared for his kingdom: so he cried out for his Grandees and Ministers, Chamberlains and Lieutenants; and, when they appeared, he said to them, ""Woe to you! Go down and search for the youth."" Now the Prince was still under the headsman's hands, but he was changed by the fright he had undergone. Presently, the Wazir, chancing to glance around, saw the Prince on the rug of blood and recognised him; so he arose and threw himself upon him, and so did the other envoys. Then they proceeded to loose his bonds and they kissed his hands and feet, whereupon Taj al-Muluk opened his eyes and, recognising his father's Wazir and his friend Aziz, fell down a fainting for excess of delight in them. When King Shahriman made sure that the coming of this army was indeed because of this youth, he was confounded and feared with great fear; so he went up to Taj al- Muluk and, kissing his head, said to him, ""O my son, be not wroth with me, neither blame the sinner for his sin; but have compassion on my grey hairs, and waste not my realm."" Whereupon Taj al-Muluk drew near unto him and kissing his hand, replied, ""No harm shall come to thee, for indeed thou art to me as my father; but look that nought befal my beloved, the Lady Dunya!"" Rejoined the King, ""O my lord! fear not for her; naught but joy shall betide her;"" and he went on to excuse himself and made his peace with Sulayman Shah's Wazir to whom he promised much money, if he would conceal from the King what he had seen. Then he bade his Chief Officers take the Prince with them and repair to the Hammam and clothe him in one of the best of his own suits and bring him back speedily. So they obeyed his bidding and bore him to the bath and clad him in the clothes which King Shahriman had set apart for him; and brought him back to the presence chamber. When he entered the King rose to receive him and made all his Grandees stand in attendance on him. Then Taj al-Muluk sat down to converse with his father's Wazir and with Aziz, and he acquainted them with what had befallen him; after which they said to him, ""During that delay we returned to thy father and gave him to know that thou didst enter the palace of the Princess and didst not return therefrom, and thy case seemed doubtful to us. But when thy sire heard of this he mustered his forces; then we came to this land and indeed our coming hath brought to thee relief in extreme case and to us great joy."" Quoth he, ""Good fortune hath attended your every action, first and last."" While this was doing King Shahriman went in to his daughter Princess Dunya, and found her wailing and weeping for Taj al-Muluk. Moreover, she had taken a sword and fixed the hilt in the ground and had set the point to the middle of her heart between her breasts; and she bent over the blade saying, ""Needs must I slay myself and not survive my beloved."" When her father entered and saw her in this case, he cried out to her, saying, ""O Princess of kings' daughters, hold thy hand and have ruth on thy sire and the folk of thy realm!"" Then he came up to her and continued, ""Let it not be that an ill thing befal thy father for thy sake!"" And he told her the whole tale that her lover was the son of King Sulayman Shah and sought her to wife and he added, ""The marriage waiteth only for thy consent."" Thereat she smiled and said, ""Did I not tell thee that he was the son of a Sultan? By Allah, there is no help for it but that I let him crucify thee on a bit of wood worth two pieces of silver!"" Replied the King, ""O my daughter, have mercy on me, so Allah have mercy on thee!"" Rejoined she, ""Up with you and make haste and go bring him to me without delay."" Quoth the King, ""On my head and eyes be it!""; and he left her and, going in hastily to Taj al-Muluk, repeated her words in his ear.[FN#53] So he arose and accompanied the King to the Princess, and when she caught sight of her lover, she took hold of him and embraced him in her father's presence and hung upon him and kissed him, saying, ""Thou hast desolated me by thine absence!"" Then she turned to her father and said, ""Sawest thou ever any that could do hurt to the like of this beautiful being, who is moreover a King, the son of a King and of the free born,[FN#54] guarded against ignoble deeds?"" There upon King Shahriman went out shutting the door on them with his own hand; and he returned to the Wazir and to the other envoys of Sulayman Shah and bade them inform their King that his son was in health and gladness and enjoying all delight of life with his beloved. So they returned to King Sulayman and acquainted him with this; whereupon King Shahriman ordered largesse of money and vivers to the troops of King Sulayman Shah; and, when they had conveyed all he had commanded, he bade be brought out an hundred coursers and an hundred dromedaries and an hundred white slaves and an hundred concubines and an hundred black slaves and an hundred female slaves; all of which he forwarded to the King as a present. Then he took horse, with his Grandees and Chief Officers, and rode out of the city in the direction of the King's camp. As soon as Sultan Sulayman Shah knew of his approach, he rose and advanced many paces to meet him. Now the Wazir and Aziz had told him all the tidings, whereat he rejoiced and cried, ""Praise be to Allah who hath granted the dearest wish of my son!"" Then King Sulayman took King Shahriman in his arms and seated him beside himself on the royal couch, where they conversed awhile and had pleasure in each other's conversation. Presently food was set before them, and they ate till they were satisfied; and sweetmeats and dried fruits were brought, and they enjoyed their dessert. And after a while came to them Taj al-Muluk, richly dressed and adorned, and when his father saw him, he stood up and embraced him and kissed him. Then all who were sitting rose to do him honour; and the two Kings seated him between them and they sat conversing a while, after which quoth King Sulayman Shah to King Shahriman, ""I desire to have the marriage contract between my son and thy daughter drawn up in the presence of witnesses, that the wedding may be made public, even as is the custom of Kings."" ""I hear and I obey,"" quoth King Shahriman and thereon summoned the Kazi and the witnesses, who came and wrote out the marriage contract between Taj al-Muluk and the Lady Dunya. Then they gave bakhshish[FN#55] of money and sweetmeats; and lavished incense and essences; and indeed it was a day of joy and gladness and all the grandees and soldiers rejoiced therein. Then King Shahriman proceeded to dower and equip his daughter; and Taj al-Muluk said to his sire, ""Of a truth, this young man Aziz is of the generous and hath done me a notable service, having borne weariness with me; and he hath travelled with me and hath brought me to my desire. He ceased never to show sufferance with me and exhort me to patience till I accomplished my intent; and now he hath abided with us two whole years, and he cut off from his native land. So now I purpose to equip him with merchandise, that he may depart hence with a light heart; for his country is nearhand."" Replied his father, ""Right is thy rede;"" so they made ready an hundred loads of the richest stuffs and the most costly, and Taj al-Muluk presented them with great store of money to Aziz, and farewelled him, saying, ""O my brother and my true friend! take these loads and accept them from me by way of gift and token of affection, and go in peace to thine own country."" Aziz accepted the presents and kissing the ground between the hands of the Prince and his father bade them adieu. Moreover, Taj al-Muluk mounted and accompanied him three miles on his homeward way as a proof of amity, after which Aziz conjured him to turn back, saying, ""By Allah, O my master, were it not for my mother, I never would part from thee! But, good my lord! leave me not without news of thee."" Replied Taj al-Muluk, ""So be it!"" Then the Prince returned to the city and Aziz journeyed on till he came to his native town; and he entered it and ceased not faring till he went in to his mother and found that she had built him a monument in the midst of the house and used to visit it continually. When he entered, he saw her with hair dishevelled and dispread over the tomb, weeping and repeating these lines, / ""Indeed I'm strong to bear whate'er befal; * /          But weak to bear such parting's dire mischance: / What heart estrangement of the friend can bear? * /          What strength withstand assault of severance?"" / Then sobs burst from her breast, and she recited also these couplets, / ""What's this? I pass by tombs, and fondly greet * /          My friends' last homes, but send they no reply: / For saith each friend, 'Reply how can I make * /          When pledged to clay and pawned to stones I lie? / Earth has consumed my charms and I forget * /          Thy love, from kith and kin poor banisht I.' "" / While she was thus, behold, Aziz came in to her and when she saw him, she fell down, fainting for very joy. He sprinkled water on her face till she revived and rising, took him in her arms and strained him to her breast, whilst he in like manner embraced her. Then he greeted her and she greeted him, and she asked the reason of his long absence, whereupon he told her all that had befallen him from first to last and informed her how Taj al-Muluk had given him an hundred loads of monies and stuffs. At this she rejoiced, and Aziz abode with his mother in his native town, weeping for what mishaps had happened to him with the daughter of Dalilah the Wily One, even her who had castrated[FN#56] him. Such was the case with Aziz; but as regards Taj al-Muluk he went in unto his beloved, the Princess Dunya, and abated her maidenhead. Then King Shahriman proceeded to equip his daughter for her journey with her husband and father in law, and bade bring them provaunt and presents and rarities. So they loaded their beasts and set forth, whilst King Shahriman escorted them, by way of farewell, three days' journey on their way, till King Shah Sulayman conjured him to return. So he took leave of them and turned back, and Taj al-Muluk and his wife and father fared for wards night and day, with their troops, till they drew near their capital. As soon as the news of their coming spread abroad, the folk decorated for them the city,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Shah Sulayman drew near his capital, the folk decorated the city for him and for his son. So they entered in state and the King, sitting on his throne with his son by his side, gave alms and largesse and loosed all who were in his jails. Then he held a second bridal for his son, and the sound of the singing women and players upon instruments was never silent for a whole month, and the tire women stinted not to adorn the Lady Dunya and display her in various dresses; and she tired not of the displaying nor did the women weary of gazing on her. Then Taj al-Muluk, after having foregathered awhile with his father and mother, took up his sojourn with his wife, and they abode in all joyance of life and in fairest fortune, till there came to them the Destroyer of all delights.[FN#57] Now when the Wazir Dandan had ended the tale of Taj al-Muluk and the Lady Dunya, Zau al-Makan said to him, ""Of a truth, it is the like of thee who lighten the mourner's heart and who deserve to be the boon companions of Kings and to guide their policy in the right way."" All this befel and they were still besieging Constantinople, where they lay four whole years, till they yearned after their native land; and the troops murmured, being weary of vigil and besieging and the endurance of fray and foray by night and by day. Then King Zau al-Makan summoned Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash, and when they were in presence bespoke them thus, ""Know that we have lain here all these years and we have not won to our wish; nay, we have but gained increase of care and concern; for indeed we came, thinking to take our man bote for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and in so doing my brother Sharrkan was slain; so is our sorrow grown to sorrows twain and our affliction to afflictions twain. All this came of the old woman Zat al-Dawahi, for it was she who slew the Sultan in his kingdom and carried off his wife, the Queen Sophia; nor did this suffice her, but she must put another cheat on us and cut the throat of my brother Sharrkan and indeed I have bound myself and sworn by the solemnest oaths that there is no help but I take blood wit from her. What say ye? Ponder my address and answer me."" Then they bowed their heads and answered, ""It is for the Wazir Dandan to opine."" So the Minister came forward and said, ""Know O King of the Age! it booteth us nought to tarry here; and 'tis my counsel that we strike camp and return to our own country, there to abide for a certain time and after that we should return for a razzia upon the worshippers of idols."" Replied the King, ""This rede is right, for indeed the folk weary for a sight of their families, and I am an other who is also troubled with yearning after my son Kanmakan and my brother 's daughter Kuzia Fakan, for she is in Damascus and I know not how is her case."" When the troops heard this report, they rejoiced and blessed the Wazir Dandan. Then the King bade the crier call the retreat after three days. They fell to preparing for the march, and, on the fourth day, they beat the big drums and unfurled the banners and the army set forth, the Wazir Danden in the van and the King riding in the mid battle, with the Grand Chamberlain by his side; and all journeyed without ceasing, night and day, till they reached Baghdad city. The folk rejoiced in their return, and care and fear ceased from them whilst the stay at homes met the absentees and each Emir betook him to his own house. As for Zau al-Makan he marched up to the Palace and went in to his son Kanmakan, who had now reached the age of seven; and who used to go down to the weapon plain and ride. As soon as the King was rested of his journey, he entered the Hammam with his son, and returning, seated himself on his sofa of state, whilst the Wazir Dandan took up his station before him and the Emirs and Lords of the realm presented themselves and stood in attendance upon him. Then Zau al-Makan called for his comrade, the Fireman, who had befriended him in his wanderings; and, when he came into presence, the King rose to do him honour and seated him by his side. Now he had acquainted the Wazir with all the kindness and good turns which the Stoker had done him; and he found that the wight had waxed fat and burly with rest and good fare, so that his neck was like an elephant's throat and his face like a dolphin's belly. Moreover, he was grown dull of wit, for that he had never stirred from his place; so at first he knew not the King by his aspect. But Zau al-Makan came up to him smiling in his face, and greeted him after the friendliest fashion, saying, ""How soon hast thou forgotten me?"" With this the Fireman roused himself and, looking steadfastly at Zau al-Makan, made sure that he knew him; whereupon he sprang hastily to his feet and exclaimed, ""O my friend, who hath made thee Sultan?"" Then Zau al- Makan laughed at him and the Wazir, coming up to him expounded the whole story to him and said, ""In good sooth he was thy brother and thy friend; and now he is King of the land and needs must thou get great good of him. So I charge thee, if he say, 'Ask a boon of me,' ask not but for some great thing; for thou art very dear to him."" Quoth the Fireman, ""I fear lest, if I ask of him aught, he may not choose to give it or may not be able to grant it."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Have no care; whatsoever thou askest he will give thee."" Rejoined the Stoker, ""By Allah, I must at once ask of him a thing that is in my thought: every night I dream of it and implore Almighty Allah to vouchsafe it to me."" Said the Wazir, ""Take heart; by Allah, if thou ask of him the government of Damascus, in place of his brother, he would surely give it thee and make thee Governor."" With this the Stoker rose to is feet and Zau al-Makan signed to him to sit; but he refused, saying, ""Allah forfend! The days are gone by of my sitting in thy presence.' Answered the Sultan, ""Not so, they endure even now. Thou west in very deed the cause that I am at present alive and, by Allah, whatever thing most desired thou requirest of me, I will give that same to thee. But ask thou first of Allah, and then of me!"" He said, ""O my lord, I fear"" ""Fear not,"" quoth the Sultan He continued, ""I fear to ask aught and that thou shouldst refuse it to me and it is only"" At this the King laughed and replied, ""If thou require of me the half of my kingdom I would share it with thee: so ask what thou wilt and leave talking."" Repeated the Fireman ""I fear"" ""Don't fear,"" quoth the King. He went on, ""I fear lest I ask a thing and thou be not able to grant it."" Upon this the Sultan waxed wroth and cried, ""Ask what thou wilt."" Then said he, ""I ask, first of Allah and then of thee, that thou write me a patent of Syndicate over all the Firemen of the baths in the Holy City, Jerusalem."" The Sultan and all present laughed and Zau al-Makan said, ""Ask something more than this."" He replied, ""O my lord, said I not I feared that thou wouldst not choose to give me what I should ask or that thou be not able to grant it?"" Therewith the Wazir signed him with his foot once and twice and thrice, and every time he began, ""I ask of thee"" Quoth the Sultan, ""Ask and be speedy."" So he said, ""I ask thee to make me Chief of the Scavengers in the Holy City of Jerusalem, or in. Damascus town."" Then all those who were present fell on their backs with laughter and the Wazir beat him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said to him, ""What art thou that thou shouldest beat me? 'Tis no fault of mine: didst thou not thyself bid me ask some important thing?"" And he added, ""Let me go to my own land."" With this, the Sultan knew that he was jesting and took patience with him awhile; then turned to him and said, ""O my brother, ask of me some important thing, befitting our dignity."" So the Stoker said, ""O King of the Age, I ask first of Allah and then of thee, that thou make me Viceroy of Damascus in the place of thy brother;"" and the King replied, ""Allah granteth thee this."" Thereupon the Fireman kissed ground before him and he bade set him a chair in his rank and vested him with a viceroy's habit. Then he wrote him a patent and sealed it with his own seal, and said to the Wazir Dandan, ""None shall go with him but thou; and when thou makest the return journey, do thou bring with thee my brother's daughter, Kuzia Fakan."" ""Hearken ing and obedience,"" answered the Minister; and, taking the Fire man, went down with him and made ready for the march. Then the King appointed for the Stoker servants and suite, and gave him a new litter and a princely equipage and said to the Emirs, ""Whoso loveth me, let him honour this man and offer him a handsome present."" So each and every of the Emirs brought him his gift according to his competence; and the King named him Zibl Khán,[FN#58] and conferred on him the honourable surname of al- Mujáhid.[FN#59] As soon as the gear was ready, he went up with the Wazir Dandan to the King, that he might take leave of him and ask his permission to depart. The King rose to him and embraced him, and charged him to do justice between his subjects and bade him make ready for fight against the Infidels after two years. Then they took leave of each other and the King,[FN#60] the Fighter for the Faith highs Zibl Khan, having been again exhorted by Zau al-Makan to deal fairly with his subjects, set out on his journey, after the Emirs had brought him Mamelukes and eunuchs, even to five thousand in number, who rode after him. The Grand Chamberlain also took horse, as did Bahram, captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, captain of the Persians, and Tarkash, captain of the Arabs, who attended to do him service; and they ceased not riding with him three days' journey by way of honour. Then, taking their leave of him, they returned to Baghdad and the Sultan Zibl Khan and the Wazir Dandan fared on, with their suite and troops, till they drew near Damascus. Now news was come, upon the wings of birds, to the notables of Damascus, that King Zau al-Makan had made Sultan over Damascus a King named Zibl Khan and surnamed Al-Mujahid; so when he reached the city he found it dressed in his honour and everyone in the place came out to gaze on him. The new Sultan entered Damascus in a splendid progress and went up to the citadel, where he sat down upon his chair of state, whilst the Wazir Dandan stood in attendance on him, to acquaint him with the ranks of the Emirs and their stations. Then the Grandees came in to him and kissed hands and called down blessings on him. The new King, Zibl Khan, received them graciously and bestowed on them dresses of honour and various presents and bounties; after which he opened the treasuries and gave largesse to the troops, great and small. Then he governed and did justice and proceeded to equip the Lady Kuzia Fakan, daughter of King Sharrkan, appointing her a litter of silken stuff. Moreover he furnished the Wazir Dandan equally well for the return journey and offered him a gift of coin but he refused, saying, ""Thou art near the time appointed by the King, and haply thou wilt have need of money, or after this we may send to seek of thee funds for the Holy War or what not."" Now when the Wazir was ready to march, Sultan al-Mujahid mounted to bid the Minister farewell and brought Kuzia Fakan to him, and made her enter the litter and sent with her ten damsels to do her service. Thereupon they set forward, whilst King ""Fighter for the Faith"" returned to his government that he might order affairs and get ready his munitions of war, awaiting such time as King Zau al- Makan should send a requisition to him. Such was the case with Sultan Zibl Khan, but as regards the Wazir Dandan, he ceased not faring forward and finishing off the stages, in company with Kuzia Fakan till they came to Ruhbah[FN#61] after a month's travel and thence pushed on, till he drew near Baghdad. Then he sent to announce his arrival to King Zau al-Makan who, when he heard this, took horse and rode out to meet him. The Wazir Dandan would have dismounted, but the King conjured him not to do so and urged his steed till he came up to his side. Then he questioned him of Zibl Khan highs Al-Mujahid, whereto the Wazir replied that he was well and that he had brought with him Kuzia Fakan the daughter of his brother. At this the King rejoiced and said to Dandan, ""Down with thee and rest thee from the fatigue of the journey for three days, after which come to me again."" Replied the Wazir ""With joy and gratitude,"" and betook himself to his own house, whilst the King rode up to his Palace and went in to his brother's daughter, Kuzia Fakan, a girl of eight years old. When he saw her, he rejoiced in her and sorrowed for her sire; then he bade make for her clothes and gave her splendid jewelry and ornaments, and ordered she be lodged with his son Kanmakan in one place. So they both grew up the brightest of the people of their time and the bravest; but Kuzia Fakan became a maiden of good sense and understanding and knowledge of the issues of events, whilst Kanmakan approved him a generous youth and freehanded, taking no care in the issue of aught. And so they continued till each of them attained the age of twelve. Now Kuzia Fakan used to ride a horseback and fare forth with her cousin into the open plain and push forward and range at large with him in the word; and they both learnt to smite with swords and spike with spears. But when they had reached the age of twelve, King Zau al-Makan, having completed his preparations and provisions and munitions for Holy War, summoned the Wazir Dandan and said to him, ""Know that I have set mind on a thing, which I will discover to thee, and I want shine opinion thereon; so do thou with speed return me a reply."" Asked the Wazir, ""What is that, O King of the Age?""; and the other answered, ""I am resolved to make my son Kanmakan Sultan and rejoice in him in my lifetime and do battle before him till death overtake me. What reckest thou of this?"" The Wazir kissed the ground before the King and replied, ""Know, O King and Sultan mine, Lord of the Age and the time! that which is in thy mind is indeed good, save that it is now no tide to carry it out, for two reasons; the first, that thy son Kanmakan is yet of tender years; and the second, that it often befalleth him who maketh his son King in his life time, to live but a little while thereafterward.[FN#62] And this is my reply."" Rejoined the King, ""Know, O Wazir that we will make the Grand Chamberlain guardian over him, for he is now one of the family and he married my sister, so that he is to me as a brother."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Do what seemeth good to thee: we have only to obey thine orders."" Then the King sent for the Grand Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence together with the Lords of the realm and he said to them, ""Ye know that this my son Kanmakan is the first cavalier of the age, and that he hath no peer in striking with the sword and lunging with the lance; and now I appoint him to be Sultan over you and I make the Grand Chamberlain, his uncle, guardian over him."" Replied the Chamberlain, ""I am but a tree which thy bounty hath planted""; and Zau al-Makan said, ""O Chamberlain, verily this my son Kanmakan and my niece Kuzia Fakan are brothers' children; so I hereby marry her to him and I call those present to witness thereof."" Then he made over to his son such treasures as no tongue can describe, and going in to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, told her what he had done, whereat she was a glad woman and said, ""Verily the twain are my children: Allah preserve thee to them and keep thy life for them many a year!"" Replied he, ""O my sister, I have accomplished in this world all my heart desired and I have no fear for my son! yet it were well thou have an eye on him, and an eye on his mother."" And he charged the Chamberlain and Nuzhat al-Zaman with the care of his son and niece and wife, and this he continued to do nights and days till he fell sick and deemed surely that he was about to drink the cup of death; so he took to his bed, whilst the Chamberlain busied himself with ordering the folk and realm. At the end of the year, the King summoned his son Kanmakan and the Wazir Dandan and said, ""O my son, after my death this Wazir is thy sire; for know that I am about to leave this house of life transitory for the house of eternity. And indeed I have fulfilled my will of this world; yet there remaineth in my heart one regret which may Allah dispel through and by thy hands."" Asked his son, ""What regret is that, O my father?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""O my son, the sole regret of me is that I die without having avenged thy grandfather, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and thine uncle, Sharrkan, on an old woman whom they call Zat al-Dawahi; but, if Allah grant thee aid, sleep not till thou take thy wreak on her, and so wipe out the shame we have suffered at the Infidel's hands; and beware of the old hag's wile and do what the Wazir Dandan shall advise thee; because he from old time hath been the pillar of our realm."" And his son assented to what he said. Then the King's eyes ran over with tears and his sickness redoubled on him; whereupon his brother in law, the Chamberlain took charge over the country and, being a capable man, he judged and bade and forbade for the whole of that year, while Zau al-Makan was occupied with his malady. And his sickness was sore upon him for four years, during which the Chief Chamberlain sat in his stead and gave full satisfaction to the commons and the nobles; and all the country blessed his rule. Such was the case with Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain, but as regards the King's son, he busied himself only with riding and lunging with lance and shooting with shaft, and thus also did the daughter of his uncle, Kuzia Fakan; for he and she were won't to fare forth at the first of the day and return at nightfall, when she would go in to her mother, and he would go in to his mother whom he ever found sitting in tears by the head of his father's couch. Then he would tend his father all night long till daybreak, when he would go forth again with his cousin according to their won't. Now Zau al-Makan's pains and sufferings were lonesome upon him and he wept and began versifying with these couplets, / ""Gone is my strength, told is my tale of days * /          And, lookye! I am left as thou dost see: / In honour's day most honoured won't to be, * /          And win the race from all my company / Would Heaven before my death I might behold * /          My son in seat of empire sit for me / And rush upon his foes, to take his wreak * /          With sway of sword and lance lunged gallantly: / In this world and the next I am undone, * /          Except the Lord vouchsafe me clemency."" / When he had ended repeating these verses, he laid his head on his pillow and closed his eyes and slept. Then saw he in his sleep one who said to him, ""Rejoice, for thy son shall fill the lands with justest sway; and he shall rule them and him shall the lieges obey.""; Then he awoke from his dream gladdened by the good tidings he had seen, and after a few days, Death smote him, and because of his dying great grief fell on the people of Baghdad, and simple and gentle mourned for him. But Time passed over him, as though he had never been[FN#63] and Kanmakan's estate was changed; for the people of Baghdad set him aside and put him and his family in a place apart. Now when his mother saw this, she fell into the sorriest of plights and said, ""There is no help but that I go to the Grand Chamberlain, and I must hope for the aidance of the Subtle, the All-Wise!"" Then she rose from her place and betook herself to the house of the Chamberlain who was now become Sultan, and she found him sitting upon his carpet. So she went in to his wife, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and wept with sore weeping and said unto her, ""Verily the dead hath no friend! May Allah never bring you to want as long as your age and the years endure, and may you cease not to rule justly over rich and poor. Thine ears have heard and thine eyes have seen all that was ours of kingship and honour and dignity and wealth and fair fortune of life and condition; and now Time hath turned upon us, and fate and the world have betrayed us and wrought in hostile way with us, wherefore I come to thee craving thy favours, I from whom favours were craved: for when a man dieth, women and maidens are brought to despisal."" And she repeated these couplets, / ""Suffice thee Death such marvels can enhance, * /          And severed lives make lasting severance: / Man's days are marvels, and their stations are * /          But water-pits[FN#64] of misery and mischance. / Naught wrings my heart save loss of noble friends, * /          Girt round by rings of hard, harsh circumstance."" / When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard these words, she remembered her brother, Zau al-Makan, and his son Kanmakan, and, making her draw near to her and showing her honour, she said, ""Verily at this moment, by Allah, I am grown rich and thou art poor; now by the Lord! we did not cease to seek thee out, but we feared to wound thy heart lest thou shouldest fancy our gifts to thee an alms gift. Withal, whatso weal we now enjoy is from thee and thy husband; so our house is thy house and our place thy place, and thine is all our wealth and what goods we have belong to thee."" Then she robed her in sumptuous robes and set apart for her a place in the Palace adjoining her own; and they abode therein, she and her son, in all delight of life. And Nuzhat al-Zaman clothed him also in Kings' raiment and gave to them both especial handmaids for their service. After a little, she related to her husband the sad case of the widow of her brother, Zau al-Makan, whereat his eyes filled with tears and he said, ""Wouldest thou see the world after thee, look thou upon the world after other than thyself. Then entreat her honourably and enrich her poverty.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When It was the One Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman related to her husband the sad case of the widow of her brother, Zau al-Makan, the Chamberlain said, ""Entreat her honourably and enrich her poverty."" Thus far concerning Nuzhat al-Zaman and her consort and the relict of Zau al-Makan; but as regards Kanmakan and his cousin Kuzia Fakan, they grew up and flourished till they waxed like unto two fruit-laden boughs or two shining moons; and they reached the age of fifteen. And she was indeed the fairest of maids who are modestly veiled, lovely faced with smooth cheeks graced, and slender waist on heavy hips based; and her shape was the shaft's thin line and her lips were sweeter than old wine and the nectar of her mouth as it were the fountain Salsabíl[FN#65]; even as saith the poet in these two couplets describing one like her, / ""As though ptisane of wine on her lips honey dew * /          Dropt from the ripened grapes her mouth in clusters grew / And, when her frame thou doublest, and low bends her vine, * /          Praise her Creator's might no creature ever knew."" / Of a truth Allah had united in her every charm: her shape would shame the branch of waving tree and the rose before her cheeks craved lenity; and the honey dew of her lips of wine made jeer, however old and clear, and she gladdened heart and beholder with joyous cheer, even as saith of her the poet, / ""Goodly of gifts is she, and charm those perfect eyes, * /          With lashes shaming Kohl and all the fair ones Kohl'd[FN#66] / And from those eyne the glances pierce the lover's heart, * /          Like sword in Mír al-Muminína Ali's hold."" / And (the relator continueth) as for Kanmakan, he became unique in loveliness and excelling in perfection no less; none could even him in qualities as in seemliness and the sheen of velour between his eyes was espied, testifying for him while against him it never testified. The hardest hearts inclined to his side; his eyelids bore lashes black as by Kohl; and he was of surpassing worth in body and soul. And when the down of lips and cheeks began to sprout bards and poets sang for him far and near, / ""Appeared not my excuse till hair had clothed his cheek, * /          And gloom o'ercrept that side-face (sight to stagger!) / A fawn, when eyes would batten on his charms, * /          Each glance deals thrust like point of Khanjar-dagger."" / And saith another, / ""His lovers' souls have drawn upon his cheek * /          An ant that perfected its rosy light: / I marvel at such martyrs Lazá-pent * /          Who yet with greeny robes of Heaven are dight.''[FN#67] / Now it chanced one holiday, that Kuzia Fakan fared forth to make festival with certain kindred of the court, and she went surrounded by her handmaids. And indeed beauty encompassed her, the roses of her cheeks dealt envy to their mole; from out her smiling lips levee flashed white, gleaming like the chamomile[FN#68]; and Kanmakan began to turn about her and devour her with his sight, for she was the moon of resplendent light. Then he took heart and giving his tongue a start began to improvise, / ""When shall the disappointed heart be healed of severance, * /          And lips of Union smile at ceasing of our hard mischance? / Would Heaven I knew shall come some night, and with it surely /          bring * Meeting with friend who like myself endureth /          sufferance.""[FN#69] / When Kuzia Fakan heard these couplets, she showed vexation and disapproval and, putting on a haughty and angry air, said to him, ""Dost thou name me in thy verse, to shame me amongst folk? By Allah, if thou turn not from this talk, I will assuredly complain of thee to the Grand Chamberlain, Sultan of Khorasan and Baghdad and lord of justice and equity; that disgrace and punishment may befal thee!"" Kanmakan made no reply for anger but he returned to Baghdad; and Kuzia Fakan also returned to her palace and complained of her cousin to her mother, who said to her, ""O my daughter, haply he meant thee no harm, and is he aught but an orphan? Withal, he said nought of reproach to thee; so beware thou tell none of this, lest perchance it come to e Sultan's ears and he cut short his life and blot out his name and make it even as yesterday, whose memory hath passed away."" However, Kanmakan's love for Kuzia Fakan spread abroad in Baghdad, so that the women talked of it. Moreover, his breast became straitened and his patience waned and he knew not what to do, yet he could not hide his condition from the world. Then longed he to give vent to the pangs he endured, by reason of the lowe of separation; but he feared her rebuke and her wrath; so he began improvising, / ""Now is my dread to incur reproaches, which * /          Disturb her temper and her mind obscure, / Patient I'll bear them; e'en as generous youth his case to /          cure.'' * Beareth the burn of brand his case to /          cure.""[FN#70] / And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Grand Chamberlain became Sultan they named him King Sásán; and after he had assumed the throne he governed the people in righteous way. Now as he was giving audience one day, Kanmakan's verses came to his knowledge. Thereupon he repented him of the past and going in to his wife Nuzhat al-Zaman, said to her, ""Verily, to join Halfah grass and fire,[FN#71] is the greatest of risks, and man may not be trusted with woman, so long as eye glanceth and eyelid quivereth. Now thy brother's son, Kanmakan, is come to man's estate and it behoveth us to forbid him access to the rooms where anklets trinkle, and it is yet more needful to forbid thy daughter the company of men, for the like of her should be kept in the Harim."" Replied she, ""Thou sayest sooth, O wise King!"" Next day came Kanmakan according to his won't; and, going in to his aunt saluted her. She returned his salutation and said to him, ""O my son! I have some what to say to thee which I would fain leave unsaid; yet I must tell it thee despite my inclination."" Quoth he, ""Speak;"" and quoth she, Know then that thy sire the Chamberlain, the father of Kuzia Fakan, hath heard of the verses thou madest anent her, and hath ordered that she be kept in the Harim and out of thy reach; if therefore, O my son, thou want anything from us, I will send it to thee from behind the door; and thou shalt not look upon Kuzia Fakan nor shalt thou return hither from this day forth."" When he heard this he arose and withdrew with out speaking a single word; and, betaking himself to his mother related what his aunt had said. She observed, ""This all cometh of thine overtalking. Thou knowest that the news of thy passion for Kuzia Fakan is noised abroad and the tattle hath spread everywhere how thou eatest their food and thereafter thou courtest their daughter."" Rejoined he, ""And who should have her but I? She is the daughter of my father's brother and I have the best of rights to her."" Retorted his mother, ""These are idle words. Be silent, lest haply thy talk come to King Sasan's ears and it prove the cause of thy losing her and the reason of thy ruin and increase of thine affliction. They have not sent us any supper to-night and we shall die an hungered; and were we in any land but this, we were already dead of famine or of shame for begging our bread."" When Kanmakan heard these words from his mother, his regrets redoubled; his eyes ran over with tears and he complained and began improvising, / ""Minish this blame I ever bear from you: * /          My heart loves her to whom all love is due: / Ask not from me of patience jot or little, * /          Divorce of Patience by God's House! I rue: / What blamers preach of patience I unheed; * /          Here am I, love path firmly to pursue! / Indeed they bar me access to my love, * /          Here am I by God's ruth no ill I sue! / Good sooth my bones, whenas they hear thy name, * /          Quail as birds quailed when Nisus o'er them flew:[FN#72] / Ah! say to them who blame my love that I * /          Will love that face fair cousin till I die."" / And when he had ended his verses he said to his mother, ""I have no longer a place in my aunt's house nor among these people, but I will go forth from the palace and abide in the corners of the city."" So he and his mother left the court; and, having sought an abode in the neighbourhood of the poorer sort, there settled; but she used to go from time to time to King Sasan's palace and thence take daily bread for herself and her son. As this went on Kuzia Fakan took her aside one day and said to her, ""Alas, O my naunty, how is it with thy son?"" Replied she, ""O my daughter, sooth to say, he is tearful-eyed and heavy hearted, being fallen into the net of thy love."" And she repeated to her the couplets he had made; whereupon Kuzia Fakan wept and said, ""By Allah! I rebuked him not for his words, nor for ill-will to him, but because I feared for him the malice of foes. Indeed my passion for him is double that he feeleth for me; my tongue may not describe my yearning for him; and were it not for the extravagant wilfulness of his words and the wanderings of his wit, my father had not cut off from him favours that besit, nor had decreed unto him exclusion and prohibition as fit. However, man's days bring nought but change, and patience in all case is most becoming: peradventure He who ordained our severance will vouchsafe us reunion!"" And she began versifying in these two couplets, / ""O son of mine uncle! same sorrow I bear, * /          And suffer the like of thy cark and thy care / Yet hide I from man what I suffer for pine; * /          Hide it too, and such secret to man never bare!"" / When his mother heard this from her, she thanked her and blessed her: then she left her and acquainted her son with what she had said; whereupon his desire for her increased and he took heart, being eased of his despair and the turmoil of his love and care. And he said, ""By Allah, I desire none but her!""; and he began improvising, / ""Leave this blame, I will list to no flout of my foe! * /          I divulged a secret was told me to keep: / He is lost to my sight for whose union I yearn, * /          And I watch all the while he can slumber and sleep."" / So the days and nights went by whilst Kanmakan lay tossing upon coals of fire,[FN#73] till he reached the age of seventeen; and his beauty had waxt perfect and his wits were at their brightest. One night, as he lay awake, he communed with himself and said, ""Why should I keep silence till I waste away and see not my lover? Fault have I none save poverty; so, by Allah, I am resolved to remove me from this region and wander over the wild and the word; for my position in this city is a torture and I have no friend nor lover therein to comfort me; wherefore I am determined to distract myself by absence from my native land till I die and take my rest after this shame and tribulation."" And he began to improvise and recited these couplets, / ""Albeit my vitals quiver 'neath this ban; * /          Before the foe myself I'll ne'er unman! / So pardon me, my vitals are a writ * /          Whose superscription are my tears that ran: / Heigh ho! my cousin seemeth Houri may * /          Come down to earth by reason of Rizwan: / 'Scapes not the dreadful sword lunge of her look * /          Who dares the glancing of those eyne to scan: / O'er Allah's wide spread world I'll roam and roam, * /          And from such exile win what bread I can / Yes, o'er broad earth I'll roam and save my soul, * /          All but her absence bear ing like a man / With gladsome heart I'll haunt the field of fight, * /          And meet the bravest Brave in battle van!"" / So Kanmakan fared forth from the palace barefoot and he walked in a short sleeved gown, wearing on his head a skull cap of felt[FN#74] seven years old and carrying a scone three days stale, and in the deep glooms of night betook himself to the portal of al-Arij of Baghdad. Here he waited for the gate being opened and when it was opened, he was the first to pass through it; and he went out at random and wandered about the wastes night and day. When the dark hours came, his mother sought him but found him not; whereupon the world waxt strait upon her for all that it was great and wide, and she took no delight in aught of weal it supplied. She looked for him a first day and a second day and a third day till ten days were past, but no news of him reached her. Then her breast became contracted and she shrieked and shrilled, saying, ""O my son! O my darling! thou hast revived my regrets. Sufficed not what I endured, but thou must depart from my home? After thee I care not for food nor joy in sleep, and naught but tears and mourning are left me. O my son, from what land shall I call thee? And what town hath given thee refuge?"" Then her sobs burst out, and she began repeating these couplets, / ""Well learnt we, since you left, our grief and sorrow to /          sustain, * While bows of severance shot their shafts in /          many a railing rain: / They left me, after girthing on their selles of corduwayne * /          To fight the very pangs of death while spanned they sandy /          plain: / Mysterious through the nightly gloom there came the moan of /          dove; * A ring dove, and replied I, 'Cease thy plaint, how /          durst complain?' / If, by my life, her heart, like mine, were full of pain and /          pine * She had not decks her neck with ring nor sole with /          ruddy stain.[FN#75] / Fled is mine own familiar friend, bequeathing me a store * /          Of parting pang and absence ache to suffer evermore."" / Then she abstained from food and drink and gave herself up to excessive tear shedding and lamentation. Her grief became public property far and wide and all the people of the town and country side wept with her and cried, ""Where is thine eye, O Zau al- Makan?"" And they bewailed the rigours of Time, saying, ""Would Heaven we knew what hath befallen Kanmakan that he fled his native town, and chased himself from the place where his father used to fill all in hungry case and do justice and grace?"" And his mother redoubled her weeping and wailing till the news of Kanmakan's departure came to King Sasan.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Fortieth Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that came to King Sasan the tidings of the departure of Kanmakan, through the Chief Emirs who said to him, ""Verily he is the son of our Sovran and the seed of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and it hath reached us that he hath exiled himself from the land."" When King Sasan heard these words, he was wroth with them and ordered one of them to be hanged by way of silencing him, whereat the fear of him fell upon the hearts of all the other Grandees and they dared not speak one word. Then he called to mind all the kindness that Zau al-Makan had done him, and how he had charged him with the care of his son; wherefore he grieved for Kanmakan and said, ""Needs must I have search made for him in all countries."" So he summoned Tarkash and bade him choose an hundred horse and wend with them in quest of the Prince. Accordingly he went out and was absent ten days, after which he returned and said, ""I can learn no tidings of him and have hit on no trace of him, nor can any tell me aught of him."" Upon this King Sasan repented him of that which he had done by the Prince; whilst his mother abode in unrest continual nor would patience come at her call: and thus passed over her twenty days in heaviness all. This is how it fared with these; but as regards Kanmakan, when he left Baghdad, he went forth perplexed about his case and knowing not whither he should go: so he fared on alone through the desert for three days and saw neither footman nor horseman; withal, his sleep fled and his wakefulness redoubled, for he pined after his people and his homestead. He ate of the herbs of the earth and drank of its flowing waters and siesta'd under its trees at hours of noontide heats, till he turned from that road to another way and, following it other three days, came on the fourth to a land of green leas, dyed with the hues of plants and trees and with sloping valley sides made to please, abounding with the fruits of the earth. It had drunken of the cups of the cloud, to the sound of thunders rolling loud and the song of the turtle-dove gently sough'd, till its hill slopes were brightly verdant and its fields were sweetly fragrant. Then Kanmakan recalled his father's city Baghdad, and for excess of emotion he broke out into verse, / ""I roam, and roaming hope I to return; * /          Yet of returning see not how or when: / I went for love of one I could not win, * /          Nor way of 'scaping ills that pressed could ken."" / When he ended his recital he wept, but presently he wiped away his tears and ate of the fruits of the earth enough for his present need. Then he made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the ordained prayers which he had neglected all this time; and he sat resting in that place through the livelong day. When night came he slept and ceased not sleeping till midnight, when he awoke and heard a human voice declaiming these couplets, / ""What's life to me, unless I see the pearly sheen * /          Of teeth I love, and sight that glorious mien? / Pray for her Bishops who in convents reign, * /          Vying to bow before that heavenly queen. / And Death is lighter than the loved one's wrath, * /          Whose phantom haunts me seen in every scene: / O joy of cup companions, when they meet, * /          And loved and lover o'er each other lean! / E'en more in time of spring, the lord of flowers, * /          When fragrant is the world with bloom and green: / Drainer of vine-juice! up wi' thee, for now * /          Earth is a Heaven where sweet waters flow.[FN#76]"" / When Kanmakan heard these distichs his sorrows surged up; his tears ran down his cheeks like freshets and flames of fire darted into his heart. So he rose to see who it was that spake these words, but saw none for the thickness of the gloom; whereupon passion increased on him and he was frightened and restlessness possessed him. He descended from his place to the sole of the valley and walked along the banks of the stream, till he heard the same voice sighing heavy sighs and reciting these couplets, / ""Tho' 'tis thy won't to hide thy love perforce, * /          Yet weep on day of parting and divorce! / Twixt me and my dear love were plighted vows; * /          Pledge of reunion, fonder intercourse: / With joy inspires my heart and deals it rest * /          Zephyr, whose coolness doth desire enforce. / O Sa'adá,[FN#77] thinks of me that anklet wearer? * /          Or parting broke she troth without remorse? / And say! shall nights foregather us, and we * /          Of suffered hardships tell in soft discourse? / Quoth she, 'Thou'rt daft for us and fey'; quoth I, * /          ' 'Sain thee! how many a friend hast turned to corse!' / If taste mine eyes sweet sleep while she's away, * /          Allah with loss of her these eyne accurse. / O wounds in vitals mine! for cure they lack * /          Union and dewy lips' sweet theriack.""[FN#78] / When Kanmakan heard this verse again spoken by the same voice yet saw no one, he knew that the speaker was a lover like unto himself, debarred from union with her who loved him; and he said to himself, ""'Twere fitting that this man should lay his head to my head and become my comrade in this my strangerhood.""[FN#79] Then he hailed the speaker and cried out to him, saying, ""O thou who farest in sombrest night, draw near to me and tell me thy tale haply thou shalt find me one who will succour thee in thy sufferings."" And when the owner of the voice heard these words, he cried out, ""O thou that respondest to my complaint and wouldest hear my history, who art thou amongst the knights? Art thou human or Jinni? Answer me speedily ere thy death draw near for I have wandered in this desert some twenty days and have seen no one nor heard any voice but thy voice."" At these words Kanmakan said to himself, ""This one's case is like my case, for I, even I, have wandered twenty days, nor during my wayfare have I seen man or heard voice:"" and he added, ""I will make him no answer till day arise."" So he was silent, and the voice again called out to him, saying, ""O thou that callest, if thou be of the Jinn fare in peace and, if thou be man, stay awhile till the day break stark and the night flee with the dark."" The speaker abode in his place and Kanmakan did likewise and the twain in reciting verses never failed, and wept tears that railed till the light of day began loom and the night departed with its gloom. Then Kanmakan looked at the other and found him to be of the Badawi Arabs, a youth in the flower of his age; clad in worn clothes and bearing in baldrick a rusty sword which he kept sheathed, and the signs of love longing were apparent on him. He went up to him and accosted him and saluted him, and the Badawi returned the salute and greeted him with courteous wishes for his long life, but somewhat despised him, seeing his tender years and his condition, which was that of a pauper. So he said to him, ""O youth, of what tribe art thou and to whom art thou kin among the Arabs; and what is thy history that thou goest by night, after the fashion of knights? Indeed thou spakest to me in the dark words such as are spoken of none but doughty cavaliers and lion- like warriors; and now I hold thy life in hand. But I have compassion on thee by reason of thy green years; so I will make thee my companion and thou shalt go with me, to do me service."" When Kanmakan heard him speak these unseemly words, after showing him such skill in verse, he knew that he despised him and would presume with him; therefore he answered him with soft and well- chosen speech, saying, ""O Chief of the Arabs, leave my tenderness of age and tell me why thou wanderest by night in the desert reciting verses. Thou talkest, I see, of my serving thee; who then art thou and what moved thee to talk this wise?"" Answered he, ""Hark ye, boy! I am Sabbáh, son of Rammáh bin Humám.[FN#80] My people are of the Arabs of Syria and I have a cousin, Najmah highs, who to all that look on her brings delight. And when my father died I was brought up in the house of his brother, the father of Najmah; but as soon I grew up and my uncle's daughter became a woman, they secluded her from me and me from her, seeing that I was poor and without money in pouch. Then the Chiefs of the Arabs and the heads of the tribes rebuked her sire, and he was abashed before them and consented to give me my cousin, but upon condition that I should bring him as her dower fifty head of horses and fifty dromedaries which travel ten days[FN#81] without a halt and fifty camels laden with wheat and a like number laden with barley, together with ten black slaves and ten handmaids. Thus the weight he set upon me was beyond my power to bear; for he exacted more than the marriage settlement as by law established. So here am I, travelling from Syria to Irak, and I have passed twenty days with out seeing other than thyself; yet I mean to go to Baghdad that I may ascertain what merchant men of wealth and importance start thence. Then will I fare forth in their track and loot their goods, and I will slay their escort and drive off their camels with their loads. But what manner of man art thou?"" Replied Kanmakan, ""Thy case is like unto my case, save that my evil is more grievous than thine ill; for my cousin is a King's daughter and the dowry of which thou hast spoken would not content her people, nor would they be satisfied with the like of that from me."" Quoth Sabbah, ""Surely thou art a fool or thy wits for excess of passion are gathering wool! How can thy cousin be a King's daughter? Thou hast no sign of royal rank on thee, for thou art but a mendicant."" Re joined Kanmakan, ""O Chief of the Arabs, let not this my case seem strange to thee; for what happened, happened;[FN#82] and if thou desire proof of me, I am Kanmakan, son of King Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman Lord of Baghdad and the realm Khorasan; and Fortune banned me with her tyrant ban, for my father died and my Sultanate was taken by King Sasan. So I fled forth from Baghdad secretly, lest I be seen of any man, and have wandered twenty days without any but thyself to scan. So now I have discovered to thee my case, and my story is as thy story and my need as thy need."" When Sabbab heard this, he cried out, ""O my joy, I have attained my desire! I will have no loot this day but thy self; for since thou art of the seed of Kings and hast come out in beggar's garb, there is no help but thy people will seek thee; and, if they find thee in any one's power, they will ransom thee with monies galore. So show me thy back, O my lad, and walk before me."" Answered Kanmakan, ""O brother of the Arabs, act not on this wise, for my people will not buy me with silver nor with gold, not even with a copper dirham; and I am a poor man, having with me neither much nor little, so cease then to be upon this track and take me to thy comrade. Fare we forth for the land of Irak and wander over the world, so haply we may win dower and marriage portion, and we may seek and enjoy our cousins' kisses and embraces when we come back."" Hearing this, Sabbah waxed angry; his arrogance and fury redoubled and he said, ""Woe to thee! Dost thou bandy words with me, O vilest of dogs that be? Turn thee thy back, or I will come down on thee with clack!"" Kanmakan smiled and answered, ""Why should I turn my back for thee? Is there no justice in thee? Dost thou not fear to bring blame upon the Arab men by driving a man like myself captive, in shame and disdain, before thou hast proved him on the plain, to know if he be a warrior or of cowardly strain?"" Upon this Sabbah laughed and replied, ""By Allah, a wonder! Thou art a boy in years told, but in talk thou art old. These words should come from none but a champion doughty and bold: what wantest thou of justice?"" Quoth Kanmakan, ""If thou wilt have me thy captive, to wend with thee and serve thee, throw down thine arms and put off thine outer gear and come on and wrestle with me; and whichever of us throw his opponent shall have his will of him and make him his boy."" Then Sabbah laughed and said, ""I think this waste of breath de noteth the nearness of thy death."" Then he arose and threw down his weapon and, tucking up his skirt, drew near unto Kanmakan who also drew near and they gripped each other. But the Badawi found that the other had the better of him and weighed him down as the quintal downweighs the diner; and he looked at his legs firmly planted on the ground, and saw that they were as two minarets[FN#83] strongly based, or two tent-poles in earth encased, or two mountains which may not he displaced. So he acknowledged himself to be a failure and repented of having come to wrestle with him, saying in himself, ""Would I had slain him with my weapon!"" Then Kanmakan took hold of him and mastering him, shook him till the Badawi thought his bowels would burst in his belly, and he broke out, ""Hold thy hand, O boy!"" He heeded not his words, but shook him again and, lifting him from the ground, made with him towards the stream, that he might throw him therein: where upon the Badawi roared out, saying, ""O thou valiant man, what wilt thou do with me?""[FN#84] Quoth he, ""I mean to throw thee into this stream: it will bear thee to the Tigris. The Tigris will bring thee to the river Isa and the Isa will carry thee to the Euphrates, and the Euphrates will land thee in shine own country; so thy tribe shall see thee and know thy manly cheer and how thy passion be sincere."" Then Sabbah cried aloud and said, ""O Champion of the desert lair, do not with me what deed the wicked dare but let me go, by the life of thy cousin, the jewel of the fair!"" Hearing this, Kanmakan set him on the ground, but when he found him self at liberty, he ran to his sword and targe and taking them up stood plotting in himself treachery and sudden assault on his adversary.[FN#85] The Prince kenned his intent in his eye and said to him, ""I con what is in thy heart, now thou hast hold of thy sword and thy targe. Thou hast neither length of hand nor trick of wrestling, but thou thinkest that, wert thou on thy mare and couldst wheel about the plain, and ply me with thy skene, I had long ago been slain. But I will give thee thy requite, so there may be left in thy heart no despite; now give me the targe and fall on me with thy whinger; either thou shalt kill me or I shall kill thee."" ""Here it is,"" answered Sabbah and, throwing him the targe, bared his brand and rushed at him sword in hand; Kanmakan hent the buckler in his right and began to fend himself with it, whilst Sabbah struck at him, saying at each stroke, ""This is the finishing blow!"" But it fell harmless enow, for Kanmakan took all on his buckler and it was waste work, though he did not reply lacking the wherewithal to strike and Sabbah ceased not to smite at him with his sabre, till his arm was weary. When his opponent saw this, he rushed upon him and, hugging him in his arms, shook him and threw him to the ground. Then he turned him over on his face and pinioned his elbows behind him with the baldrick of his sword, and began to drag him by the feet and to make for the river. Thereupon cried Sabbah, ""What wilt thou do with me, O youth, and cavalier of the age and brave of the plain where battles rage?"" Answered he, ""Did I not tell thee that it was my intent to send thee by the river to thy kin and to thy tribe, that thy heart be not troubled for them nor their hearts be troubled for thee, and lest thou miss thy cousin's bride-feast!"" At this Sabbah shrieked aloud and wept and screaming said, ""Do not thus, O champion of the time's braves! Let me go and make me one of thy slaves!"" And he wept and wailed and began reciting these verses, / ""I'm estranged fro' my folk and estrangement's long: * /          Shall I die amid strangers? Ah, would that I kenned! / I die, nor my kinsman shall know where I'm slain, * /          Die in exile nor see the dear face of my friend!"" / Thereupon Kanmakan had compassion on him and said, ""Make with me a covenant true and swear me an oath to be a comrade as due and to bear me company wheresoever I may go."" ""'Tis well,"" replied Sabbah and swore accordingly. Then Kanmakan loosed him and he rose and would have kissed the Prince's hand; but he forbade him that. Then the Badawi opened his scrip and, taking out three barley scones, laid them before Kanmakan and they both sat down on the bank of the stream to eat.[FN#86] When they had done eating together, they made the lesser ablution and prayed; after which they sat talking of what had befallen each of them from his people and from the shifts of Time. Presently said Kanmakan, ""Whither dost thou now intend?"" Replied Sabbah, ""I purpose to repair to Baghdad, thy native town, and abide there, until Allah vouchsafe me the marriage portion."" Rejoined the other, ""Up then and to the road! I tarry here."" So the Badawi farewelled him and took the way for Baghdad, whilst Kanmakan remained behind, saying to himself, ""O my soul, with what face shall I return pauper- poor? Now by Allah, I will not go back empty handed and, if the Almighty please, I will assuredly work my deliverance."" Then he went to the stream and made the Wuzu-washing and when prostrating he laid his brow in the dust and prayed to the Lord, saying, ""O Allah! Thou who sendest down the dew, and feedest the worm that homes in the stone, I beseech Thee vouchsafe me my livelihood of Thine Omnipotence and the Grace of Thy benevolence!"" Then he pronounced the salutation which closes prayer; yet every road appeared closed to him. And while he sat turning right and left, behold, he espied a horseman making towards him with bent back and reins slack. He sat up right and after a time reached the Prince; and the stranger was at the last gasp and made sure of death, for he was grievously wounded when he came up; the tears streamed down his cheeks like water from the mouths of skins, and he said to Kanmakan, ""O Chief of the Arabs, take me to thy friendship as long as I live, for thou wilt not find my like; and give me a little water though the drinking of water be harmful to one wounded, especially whilst the blood is flowing and the life with it. And if I live, I will give thee what shall heal thy penury and thy poverty: and if I die, mayst thou be blessed for thy good intent."" Now under that horseman was a stallion, so noble a Rabite[FN#87] the tongue fails to describe him; and as Kanmakan looked at his legs like marble shafts, he was seized with a longing and said to himself, ""Verily the like of this stallion[FN#88] is not to be found in our time."" Then he helped the rider to alight and entreated him in friendly guise and gave him a little water to swallow; after which he waited till he had taken rest and addressed him, saying, ""Who hath dealt thus with thee?"" Quoth the rider, ""I will tell thee the truth of the case. I am a horse thief and I have busied myself with lifting and snatching horses all my life, night and day, and my name is Ghassan, the plague of every stable and stallion. I heard tell of this horse, that he was in the land of Roum, with King Afridun, where they had named him Al-Katúl and surnamed him Al Majnún.[FN#89] So I journeyed to Constantinople for his sake and watched my opportunity and whilst I was thus waiting, there came out an old woman, one highly honoured among the Greeks, and whose word with them is law, by name Zat al-Dawahi, a past mistress in all manner of trickery. She had with her this steed and ten slaves, no more, to attend on her and the horse; and she was bound for Baghdad and Khorasan, there to seek King Sasan and to sue for peace and pardon from ban. So I went out in their track, longing to get at the horse,[FN#90] and ceased not to follow them, but was unable to come by the stallion, because of the strict guard kept by the slaves, till they reached this country and I feared lest they enter the city of Baghdad. As I was casting about to steal the stallion lo! a great cloud of dust arose on them and walled the horizon. Presently it opened and disclosed fifty horsemen, gathered together to waylay merchants on the highway, and their captain, by name Kahrdash, was a lion in daring and dash; a furious lion who layeth knights flat as carpets in battle-crash.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Forty-first Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the wounded rider spake thus to Kanmakan, ""Then came out the same Kahrdash, and fell on the old woman and her men and bore down upon them bashing them, nor was it long before they bound her and the ten slaves and bore off their captives and the horse, rejoicing. When I saw this, I said to myself, 'My pains were in vain nor did I attain my gain.' However, I waited to see how the affair would fare, and when the old woman found herself in bonds, she wept and said to the captain, Kahrdash, 'O thou doughty Champion and furious Knight, what wilt thou do with an old woman and slaves, now that thou hast thy will of the horse?' And she beguiled him with soft words and she sware that she would send him horses and cattle, till he released her and her slaves. Then he went his way, he and his comrades, and I followed them till they reached this country; and I watched them, till at last I found an opportunity of stealing the horse, whereupon I mounted him and, drawing a whip from my wallet, struck him with it. When the robbers heard this, they came out on me and surrounded me on all sides and shot arrows and cast spears at me, whilst I stuck fast on his back and he fended me with hoofs and forehand,[FN#91] till at last he bolted out with me from amongst them like unerring shaft or shooting star. But in the stress and stowre I got sundry grievous wounds and sore; and, since that time, I have passed on his back three days without tasting food or sleeping aught, so that my strength is down brought and the world is become to me as naught. But thou hast dealt kindly with me and hast shown ruth on me; and I see thee naked stark and sorrow hath set on thee its mark, yet are signs of wealth and gentle breeding manifest on thee. So tell me, what and whence art thou and whither art thou bound?"" Answered the Prince, ""My name is Kanmakan, son of Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. When my father died and an orphan lot was my fate, a base man seized the throne and became King over small and great."" Then he told him all his past from first to last; and the horse thief said to him for he pitied him, ""By Allah, thou art one of high degree and exceeding nobility, and thou shalt surely attain estate sublime and become the first cavalier of thy time. If thou can lift me on horseback and mount thee behind me and bring me to my own land, thou shalt have honour in this world and a reward on the day of band calling to band,[FN#92] for I have no strength left to steady myself; and if this be my last day, the steed is thine alway, for thou art worthier of him than any other."" Quoth Kanmakan, By Allah, if I could carry thee on my shoulders or share my days with thee, I would do this deed without the steed! For I am of a breed that loveth to do good and to succour those in need; and one kindly action in Almighty Allah's honour averteth seventy calamities from its doer. So make ready to set out and put thy trust in the Subtle, the All- Wise."" And he would have lifted him on to the horse and fared forward trusting in Allah Aider of those who seek aid, but the horse thief said, ""Wait for me awhile. Then he closed his eyes and opening his hands, said I testify that there is no god but the God, and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God!"" And he added, ""O glorious One, pardon me my mortal sin, for none can pardon mortal sins save the Immortal!"" And he made ready for death and recited these couplets, / ""I have wronged mankind, and have ranged like wind * /          O'er the world, and in wine-cups my life has past: / I've swum torrent course to bear off the horse; * /          And my guiles high places on plain have cast. / Much I've tried to win and o'er much my sin, * /          And Katul of my winnings is most and last: / I had hoped of this steed to gain wish and need, * /          But vain was the end of this journey vast. / I have stolen through life, and my death in strife * /          Was doomed by the Lord who doth all forecast / And I've toiled these toils to their fatal end * /          For an orphan, a pauper sans kith or friend!"" / And when he had finished his verses he closed his eyes and opened his mouth; then with a single death-rattling he left this world. Thereupon Kanmakan rose and dug a grave and laid him in the dust; after which he went up to the steed and kissed him and wiped his face and joyed with exceeding joy, saying, ""None hath the fellow of this stallion; no, not even King Sasan."" Such was the case with Kanmakan; but as regards King Sasan, presently news came to him that the Wazir Dandan had thrown off his allegiance, and with him half the army who swore that they would have no King but Kanmakan: and the Minister had bound the troops by a solemn covenant and had gone with them to the Islands of India and to Berber-land and to Black-land;[FN#93] where he had levied armies from far and near, like unto the swollen sea for fear and none could tell the host's van from its rear. And the Minister was resolved to make for Baghdad and take the kingdom in ward and slay every soul who dare retard, having sworn not to return the sword of war to its sheath, till he had made Kanmakan King. When this news came to Sasan, he was drowned in the sea of appal, knowing that the whole state had turned against him, great and small; and his trouble redoubled and his care became despair. So he opened his treasuries and distributed his monies among his officers; and he prayed for Kanmakan's return, that he might draw his heart to him with fair usage and bounty; and make him commander of those troops which ceased not being faithful to him, so might he quench the sparks ere they became a flame. Now when the news of this reached Kanmakan by the merchants, he returned in haste to Baghdad on the back of the aforesaid stallion, and as King Sasan sat perplexed upon his throne he heard of the coming of Kanmakan; whereupon he despatched all the troops and head-men of the city to meet him. So all who were in Baghdad fared forth and met the Prince and escorted him to the palace and kissed the thresholds, whilst the damsels and the eunuchs went in to his mother and gave her the fair tidings of his return. She came to him and kissed him between the eyes, but he said to her, ""O mother mine, let me go to my uncle King Sasan who hath overwhelmed me with weal and boon."" And while he so did, all the palace-people and head-men marvelled at the beauty of the stallion and said, ""No King is like unto this man."" So Kanmakan went in to King Sasan and saluted him as he rose to receive him; and, kissing his hands and feet, offered him the horse as a present. The King greeted him, saying, ""Well come and welcome to my son Kanmakan! By Allah, the world hath been straitened on me by reason of thine absence, but praised be Allah for thy safety!"" And Kanmakan called down blessings on him. Then the King looked at the stallion, Al-Katul highs, and knew him for the very horse he had seen in such and such a year whilst beleaguering the Cross-worshippers of Constantinople with Kanmakan's sire, Zau al- Makan, that time they slew his uncle Sharrkan. So he said to the Prince, ""If thy father could have come by this courser, he would have bought it with a thousand blood horses: but now let the honour return to the honourable. We accept the steed and we give him back to thee as a gift, for to him thou hast more right than any wight, being knightliest of knights."" Then King Sasan bade bring forth for him dresses of honour and led horses and appointed to him the chief lodging in the palace, and showed him the utmost affection and honour, because he feared the issue of the Wazir Dandan's doings. At this Kanmakan rejoiced and shame and humiliation ceased from him. Then he went to his house and, going to his mother, asked, ""O my mother, how is it with the daughter of my uncle?"" Answered she, ""By Allah, O my son, my concern for thine absence hath distracted me from any other, even from thy beloved; especially as she was the cause of thy strangerhood and thy separation from me."" Then he complained to her of his case, saying, ""O my mother, go to her and speak with her; haply she will vouchsafe me her sight to see and dispel from me this despondency."" Replied his mother, ""Idle desires abase men's necks; so put away from thee this thought that can only vex; for I will not wend to her nor go in to her with such message.' Now when he heard his mother's words he told her what said the horse-thief concerning Zat al-Dawahi, how the old woman was then in their land purposing to make Baghdad, and added, ""It was she who slew my uncle and my grandfather, and needs must I avenge them with man-bote, that our reproach be wiped out."" Then he left her and repaired to an old woman, a wicked, whorish, pernicious beldam by name Sa'adánah and complained to her of his case and of what he suffered for love of his cousin Kuzia Fakan and begged her to go to her and win her favour for him. ""I hear and I obey,"" answered the old hag and leaving him betook herself to Kuzia Fakan's palace, that she might intercede with her in his behalf. Then she returned to him and said, ""Of a truth Kuzia Fakan saluteth thee and promiseth to visit thee this night about midnight.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. / When it was the One Hundred and Forty-second Night, / She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman came to Kanmakan and said, ""Of a truth the daughter of thine uncle saluteth thee and she will visit thee this night about midnight;"" he rejoiced and sat down to await the fulfilment of his cousin's promise. But before the hour of night she came to him, wrapped in a veil of black silk, and she went in to him and aroused him from sleep, saying, ""How canst thou pretend to love me, when thou art sleeping heart-free and in complete content?"" So he awoke and said, ""By Allah, O desire of my heart, I slept not but in the hope that thine image might visit my dreams!"" Then she chid him with soft words and began versifying in these couplets, / ""Hadst thou been leaf in love's loyalty, * /          Ne'er haddest suffered sleep to seal those eyne: / O thou who claimest lover-loyalty, * /          Treading the lover's path of pain and pine! / By Allah, O my cousin, never yet * /          Did eyes of lover sleep such sleep indign."" / Now when he heard his cousin's words, he was abashed before her and rose and excused himself. Then they embraced and complained to each other of the anguish of separation; and they ceased not thus till dawn broke and day dispersed itself over the horizon; when she rose preparing to depart. Upon this Kanmakan wept and sighed and began improvising these couplets, / ""O thou who deignest come at sorest sync, * /          Whose lips those teeth like necklaced pearls enshrine' / I kissed him[FN#94] thousand times and clips his waist, * /          And spent the night with cheek to cheek close li'en / Till to depart us twain came dawning day, * /          Like sword edge drawn from sheath in radiant line."" / And when he ended his poetry, Kuzia Fakan took leave of him and returned to her palace. Now certain of her damsels became aware of her secret, and one of these slave girls disclosed it to King Sasan, who went into Kuzia Fakan and, drawing his sabre upon her, would have slain her: but her mother Nuzhat al-Zaman entered and said to him, ""By Allah, do her no harm, for if thou hurt her, the report will be noised among the folk and thou shalt become a reproach amongst the Kings of the age! Know thou that Kanmakan is no son of adultery, but a man of honour and nobility, who would not do aught that could shame him, and she was reared with him. So be not hasty; for verily the report is spread abroad, among all the palace-people and all the folk of Baghdad, how the Wazir Dandan hath levied armies from all countries and is on his way hither to make Kanmakan King."" Quoth Sasan, ""By Allah, needs must I cast him into such calamity that neither earth shall support him nor sky shall shadow him! I did but speak him fair and show him favour because of my lieges and my lords, lest they incline to him; but right soon shalt thou see what shall betide."" Then he left her and went out to order the affairs of the realm. Such, then, was the case with King Sasan; but as regards Kanmakan, on the next day he came in to his mother and said, ""O my mother! I am resolved to ride forth a raiding and a looting: and I will cut the road of caravans and lift horses and flocks, negroes and white slaves and, as soon as I have collected great store and my case is bettered galore, I will demand my cousin Kuzia Fakan in marriage of my uncle Sasan."" Replied she, ""O my son, of a truth the goods of men are not ready to hand like a scape-camel;[FN#95] for on this side of them are sword-strokes and lance-lungings and men that eat the wild beast and lay countries waste and chase lynxes and hunt lions."" Quoth he, Heaven forefend that I turn back from my resolve, till I have won to my will! Then he despatched the old woman to Kuzia Fakan, to tell her that he was about to set out in quest of a marriage settle ment befitting her, saying to the beldam, ""Thou needs must pray her to send me an answer."" ""I hear and I obey,"" replied the old woman and going forth, presently returned with Kuzia Fakan's reply, which was, ""She will come to thee at midnight."" So he abode awake till one half of the night was passed, when restlessness get hold on him, and before he was aware she came in to him, saying, ""My life be thy ransom from wakefulness!"" and he sprang up to receive her, exclaiming, ""O desire of my heart, my life be thy redemption from all ills and evils!"" Then he acquainted her, with his intent, and she wept: but he said, ""Weep not, O daughter of my uncle; for I beseech Him who decreed our separation to vouchsafe us reunion and fair understanding."" Then Kanmakan, having fixed a day for departure, went in to his mother and took leave of her, after which came he down from his palace and threw the baldrick of his sword over his shoulder and donned turband and face-veil; and mounting his horse, Al-Katul, and looking like the moon at its full, he threaded the streets of Baghdad, till he reached the city gate. And behold, here he found Sabbah bin Rammah coming out of town; and his comrade seeing him, ran to his stirrup and saluted him. He returned his salutation, and Sabbah asked him, ""O my brother, how camest thou by this good steed and this sword and clothes, whilst I up to present time have gotten nothing but my sword and target?"" Answered Kanmakan, ""The hunter returneth not but with quarry after the measure of his intention. A little after thy departure, fortune came to me: so now say, wilt thou go with me and work thine intent in my company and journey with me in this desert?"" Replied Sabbah, ""By the Lord of the Ka'abah, from this time forth I will call thee naught but 'my lord'!"" Then he ran on before the horse, with his sword hanging from his neck and his budget between his shoulder blades, and Kanmakan rode a little behind him; and they plunged into the desert, for a space of four days, eating of the gazelles and drinking water of the springs. On the fifth day they drew near a high hill, at whose foot was a spring-encampment[FN#96] and a deep running stream; and the knolls and hollows were filled with camels and cattle and sheep and horses, and little children played about the pens and folds. When Kanmakan saw this, he rejoiced at the sight and his breast was filled with delight; so he addressed himself to fight, that he might take the camels and the cattle, and said to Sabbah, ""Come, fall with us upon this loot, whose owners have left it unguarded here, and do we battle for it with near and far, so haply may fall to our lot of goods some share."" Replied Sabbah, ""O my lord, verily they to whom these herds belong be many in number; and among them are doughty horsemen and fighting footmen; and if we venture lives in this derring do we shall fall into danger great and neither of us will return safe from this bate; but we shall both be cut off by fate and leave our cousins desolate."" Then Kanmakan laughed and knew that he was a coward; so he left him and rode down the rise, intent on rapine, with loud cries and chanting these couplets, / ""Oh a valiant race are the sons of Nu'umán, * /          Braves whose blades shred heads of the foeman-clan![FN#97] / A tribe who, when tried in the tussle of war, * /          Taketh prowess stand in the battle-van: / In their tents safe close gaberlunzie's eyne, * /          Nor his poverty's ugly features scan: / And I for their aidance sue of Him * /          Who is King of Kings and made soul of man."" / Then he rushed upon the she-camels like a he-camel in rut and drove all before him, sheep and cattle, horses and dromedaries. Therewith the slaves ran at him with their blades so bright and their lances so long; and at their head rode a Turkish horseman who was indeed a stout champion, doughty in fray and in battle chance and skilled to wield the nut-brown lance and the blade with bright glance. He drove at Kanmakan, saying, ""Woe to thee! Knewest thou to whom these herds belong thou hadst not done this deed. Know that they are the goods of the band Grecian, the champions of the ocean and the troop Circassian; and this troop containeth none but valiant wights numbering an hundred knights, who have cast off the allegiance of every Sultan. But there hath been stolen from them a noble stallion, and they have vowed not to return hence without him."" Now when Kanmakan heard these words, he cried out, saying, ""O villain, this I bestride is the steed whereof ye speak and after which ye seek, and ye would do battle with me for his sake' So come out against me, all of you at once, and do you dourest for the nonce!"" Then he shouted between the ears of Al-Katul who ran at them like a Ghul; whereupon Kanmakan let drive at the Turk[FN#98] and ran him through the body and threw him from his horse and let out his life; after which he turned upon a second and a third and a fourth, and also of life bereft them. When the slaves saw this, they were afraid of him, and he cried out and said to them, ""Ho, sons of whores, drive out the cattle and the stud or I will dye my spear in your blood."" So they untethered the beasts and began to drive them out; and Sabbah came down to Kanmakan with loud voicing and hugely rejoicing; when lo! there arose a cloud of dust and grew till it walled the view, and there appeared under of it riders an hundred, like lions an-hungered. Upon this Sabbah took flight, and fled to the hill's topmost height, leaving the assailable site, and enjoyed sight of the fight, saying, ""I am no warrior; but in sport and jest I delight.""[FN#99] Then the hundred cavaliers made towards Kanmakan and surrounded him on all sides, and one of them accosted him, saying, ""Whither goest thou with this loot?"" Quoth he, ""I have made it my prize and am carrying it away; and I forbid you from it, or come on to the combat, for know ye that he who is before you is a terrible lion and an honourable champion, and a sword that cutteth wherever it turneth!"" When the horseman heard these words, he looked at Kanmakan and saw that he was a knight like a mane-clad lion in might, whilst his face was as the full moon rising on its fourteenth night, and velour shone from between his eyes. Now that horseman was the captain of the hundred horse, and his name was Kahrdash; and when he saw in Kanmakan the perfection of cavalarice with surpassing gifts of comeliness, his beauty reminded him of a beautiful mistress of his whose name was Fátin.[FN#100] Now she was one of the fairest of women in face, for Allah had given her charms and grace and noble qualities of all kinds, such as tongue faileth to explain and which ravish the hearts of men. Moreover, the cavaliers of the tribe feared her prowess and all the champions of that land stood in awe of her high spirit; and she had sworn that she would not marry nor let any possess her, except he should conquer her in combat (Kahrdash being one of her suitors); and she said to her father, ""None shall approach me, save he be able to deal me over throw in the field and stead of war thrust and blow. Now when this news reached Kahrdash, he scorned to fight with a girl, fearing reproach; and one of his intimates said to him, ""Thou art complete in all conditions of beauty and goodliness; so if thou contend with her, even though she be stronger than thou, thou must needs overcome her; for when she seeth thy beauty and grace, she will be discomfited before thee and yield thee the victory; for verily women have a need of men e'en as thou heedest full plain."" Nevertheless Kahrdash refused and would not contend with her, and he ceased not to abstain from her thus, till he met from Kanmakan that which hath been set down. Now he took the Prince for his beloved Fatin and was afraid; albeit indeed she loved him for what she had heard of his beauty and velour; so he went up to him and said, ""Woe to thee,[FN#101] O Fatin! Thou comest here to show me thy prowess; but now alight from thy steed, that I may talk with thee, for I have lifted these cattle and have foiled my friends and waylaid many a brave and man of knightly race, all for the sake of thy beauty of form and face, which are without peer. So marry me now, that Kings' daughters may serve thee and thou shalt become Queen of these countries."" When Kanmakan heard these words, the fires of wrath flamed up in him and he cried out, ""Woe to thee, O Persian dog! Leave Fatin and thy trust and mistrust, and come to cut and thrust, for eftsoon thou shalt lie in the dust;"" and so saying, he began to wheel about him and assail him and feel the way to prevail. But when Kahrdash observed him closely he knew him for a doughty knight and a stalwart in fight; and the error of his thought became manifest to him, whenas he saw the green down on his cheeks dispread like myrtles springing from the heart of a rose bright-red. And he feared his onslaught and quoth he to those with him, ""Woe to you! Let one of you charge down upon him and show him the keen sword and the quivering spear; for know that when many do battle with one man it is foul shame, even though he be a kemperly wight and an invincible knight."" Upon this, there ran at Kanmakan a horseman like a lion in fight, mounted on a black horse with hoofs snow-white and a star on his forehead, the bigness of a dirham, astounding wit and sight, as he were Abjar, which was Antar's destrier, even as saith of him the poet, / ""The courser chargeth on battling foe, * /          Mixing heaven on high with the earth down low:[FN#102] / As though the Morning had blazed his brow, * /          And he rends her vitals as quid pro quo."" / He rushed upon Kanmakan, and they wheeled about awhile, giving blows and taking blows such as confound the sprite and dim the sight; but Kanmakan was the first to smite the foe a swashing blow, that rove through turband and iron skull cap and reached his head, and he fell from his steed with the fall of a camel when he rolleth over. Then a second came out to him and offered battle, and in like guise a third, a fourth and a fifth, and he did with them all as he had done with the first. Thereupon the rest at once rushed upon him, for indeed they were roused by rage and wild with wrath; but it was not long before he had pierced them all with the point of his spear. When Kahrdash saw these feats of arms, he feared death; for he knew that the youth was stoutest of heart and concluded that he was unique among knights and braves; and he said to Kanmakan, ""I waive my claim to thy blood and I pardon thee the blood of my comrades: so take what thou wilt of the cattle and wend thy ways, for thy firmness in fight moveth my ruth and life is better for thee than death."" Replied Kanmakan, ""Thou lackest not of the generosity of the noble! but leave this talk and run for thy life and reck not of blame nor think to get back the booty; but take the straight path for thine own safety."" Thereupon Kahrdash waxed exceeding wroth, and rage moved him to the cause of his death; so he said to Kanmakan, ""Woe to thee, an thou knew who I be, thou wouldst not wield these words in the open field. I am the lion to bash known as Kahrdash, he who spoileth great Kings and waylayeth all travellings and seizeth the merchants' preciousest things. And the steed under thee is that I am seeking; and I call upon thee to tell me how thou camest by him and hast him in thy keeping."" Replied Kan makan, ""Know thou that this steed was being carried to my uncle King Sasan, under the escort of an ancient dame high in rank attended by ten slaves, when thou fellest upon her and tookest the horse from her; and I have a debt of blood against this old woman for the sake of my grandfather King Omar bin al Nu'uman and my uncle King Sharrkan.' ""Woe to thee!"" quoth Kahrdash, ""who is thy father, O thou that hast no lawful mother?"" Quoth he, ""Know that I am Kanmakan, bin Zau al-Makan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" But when Kahrdash heard this address he said, ""Thy perfection cannot be denied, nor yet the union in thee of knightly virtue and seemlihead,"" and he added, ""Fare in peace, for thy father showed us favour."" Rejoined Kanmakan, ""By Allah, I will not deign to honour thee, O wretch I disdain, so far as to overcome thee in battle plain!"" Upon this the Badawi waxed wroth and they drove at each other, shouting aloud, whilst their horses pricked their ears and raised their tails.[FN#103] And they ceased not clashing together with such a crash that it seemed to each as if the firmament were split in sunder, and they continued to strive like two rams which butt, smiting and exchanging with their spears thrust and cut. Presently Kahrdash foined at Kanmakan; but he evaded it and rejoined upon him and so pierced him through the breast that the spearhead issued from his back. Then he collected the horses and the plunder, and he cried out to the slaves, saying, ""Up and be driving as hard as ye may!"" Hearing this, down came Sabbah and, accosting Kanmakan, said to him, ""Right well hast thou dight, O Knight of the age! Verily I prayed Allah for thee and the Lord heard my prayer."" Then he cut off Kahrdash's head and Kanmakan laughed and said, ""Woe to thee, O Sabbah! I thought thee a rider fain of fight."" Quoth the Badawi, ""Forget not thy slave in the division of the spoil, so haply therewith I may marry my cousin Najmah."" Answered Kanmakan, ""Thou shalt assuredly share in it, but now keep watch over the booty and the slaves."" Then he set out for his home and he ceased not journeying night and day till he drew near Baghdad city, and all the troops heard of Kanmakan, and saw what was his of loot and cattle and the horse-thief's head on the point of Sabbah's spear. Also (for he was a noted highwayman) the merchants knew Kahrdash's head and rejoiced, saying, ""Allah hath rid mankind of him!""; and they marvelled at his being slain and blessed his slayer. Thereupon all the people of Baghdad came to Kanmakan, seeking to know what adventures had befallen him, and he told them what had passed, whereupon all men were taken with awe of him and the Knights and champions feared him. Then he drove his spoil under the palace walls; and, planting the spear heel, on whose point was Kahrdash's head, over against the royal gate, gave largesse to the people of Baghdad, distributing horses and camels, so that all loved him and their hearts inclined to him. Presently he took Sabbah and lodged him in a spacious dwelling and gave him a share of the loot; after which he went in to his mother and told her all that had befallen him in his last journey. Meanwhile the news of him reached the King, who rose from his levee and, shutting himself up with his chief officers, said to them, ""Know ye that I desire to reveal to you my secret and acquaint you with the hidden facts of my case. And further know that Kanmakan will be the cause of our being uprooted from this kingdom, our birth place; for he hath slain Kahrdash, albeit he had with him the tribes of the Kurds and the Turks, and our affair with him will end in our destruction, seeing that the most part of our troops are his kinsmen and ye weet what the Wazir Dandan hath done; how he disowneth me, after all I have shown him of favours; and after being faithful he hath turned traitor. Indeed it hath reached me that he hath levied an army in the provinces and hath planned to make Kanmakan Sultan, for that the Sultanate was his father's and his grandfather's; and assuredly he will slay me without mercy."" Now when the Lords of the Realm heard from him these words, they replied, ""O King, verily this man.[FN#104] is unequal to this, and did we not know him to have been reared by thee, not one of us would approve of him. And know thou that we are at thy commandment; if thou desire his death, we will do him die; and if thou wilt remove him, we will remove him."" Now when King Sasan heard this, he said, ""Verily, to slay him were wise; but needs must ye swear an oath to it."" So all sware to slay Kanmakan without giving him a chance; to the end that, when the Wazir Dandan should come and hear of his death, his force might be weakened and he fail of his design. When they had made this compact and covenant with trim, the king honoured them with the highest honours and presently retired to his own apartments. But the officers deserted him and the troops refused their service and would neither mount nor dismount until they should espy what might befal, for they saw that most of the army was with the Wazir Dandan. Presently, the news of these things came to Kuzia Fakan and caused her much concern; so that she sent for the old woman who was won't to carry messages between her and her cousin, and when she came, bade her go to him and warn him of the plot. Whereto he replied, ""Bear my salutation to the daughter of my uncle and say to her, 'Verily the earth is of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!), and He giveth it as heritage to whomsoever of His servants He willeth.' How excellent is the saying of the sayer, / 'Allah holds Kingship! Whoso seeks without Him victory * /          Shall be cast out, with soul condemned to Hell of low /          degree: / Had I or any other man a finger breadth of land, * /          The rule were changed and men a twain of partner gods would /          see.' "" / Then the old woman returned to Kuzia Fakan and told her his reply and acquainted her that he abode in the city. Meanwhile, King Sasan awaited his faring forth from Baghdad, that he might send after him some who would slay him; till it befel one morning that Kanmakan went out to course and chase, accompanied by Sabbah, who would not leave him night or day. He caught ten gazelles and among them one that had tender black eyes and turned right and left: so he let her go and Sabbah said to him, ""Why didst thou free this gazelle?"" Kanmakan laughed and set the others free also, saying, ""It is only humane to release gazelles that have young, and this one turned not from side to side, save to look for her fawns: so I let her go and released the others in her honour."" Quoth Sabbah, ""Do thou release me, that I may go to my people."" At this Kanmakan laughed and smote him with the spear butt on the breast, and he fell to the ground squirming like a snake. Whilst they were thus doing, behold, they saw a dust cloud spireing high and heard the tramp of horses; and presently there appeared under it a plump of knights and braves. Now the cause of their coming was this. Some of his followers had acquainted King Sasan with Kanmakan's going out to the chase; so he sent for an Emir of the Daylamites, called Jámi' and twenty of his horsemen; and gave them money and bade them slay Kanmaken. So when they drew near the Prince, they charged down upon him and he met them in mid-charge and killed them all, to the last man. And behold, King Sasan took horse and riding out to meet his people, found them all slain, whereat he wondered and turned back; when lo! the people of the city laid hands on him and bound him straitly. As for Kanmakan after that adventure, he left the place behind him and rode onward with Sabbah the Badawi. And the while he went, lo! he saw a youth sitting at the door of a house on his road and saluted him. The youth returned his greeting and, going into the house, brought out two platters, one full of soured milk and the other of brewis swimming in clarified butter; and he set the platter before Kanmakan, saying ""Favour us by eating of our victual."" But he refused and quoth the young man to him, ""What aileth thee, O man, that thou wilt not eat?"" Quoth Kanmakan, ""I have a vow upon me."" The youth asked, ""What is the cause of thy vow?"", and Kanmakan answered, ""Know that King Sasan seized upon my kingdom like a tyrant and an enemy, although it was my father's and my grand father's before me; yet he became master of it by force after my father's death and took no count of me, by reason of my tender years. So I have bound myself by a vow to eat no man's victual till I have eased my heart of my foe."" Rejoined the youth, ""Rejoice, for Allah hath fulfilled thy vow. Know that he hath been prisoned in a certain place and methinks he will soon die."" Asked Kanmakan, ""In what house is he confined?"" ""Under yon high dome,"" answered the other. The Prince looked and saw the folk entering and buffeting Sasan, who was suffering the agonies of the dying. So he arose and went up to the pavilion and noted what was therein; after which he returned to his place and, sitting down to the proferred victual, ate what sufficed him and put the rest in his wallet. Then he took seat in his own place and ceased not sitting till it was dark night and the youth, whose guest he was slept; when he rose and repaired to the pavilion wherein Sasan was confined. Now about it were dogs guarding it, and one of them sprang at him; so he took out of his budget a bit of meat and threw it to him. He ceased not casting flesh to the dogs till he came to the pavilion and, making his way to where King Sasan was, laid his hand upon his head; whereupon he said in a loud voice, ""Who art thou?"" He replied, ""I am Kanmakan whom thou stravest to kill; but Allah made thee fall into thine evil device. Did it not suffice thee to take my kingdom and the kingdom of my father, but thou must purpose to slay me?""[FN#105] And Sasan swore a false oath that he had not plotted his death and that the bruit was untrue. So Kanmakan forgave him and said to him, ""Follow me."" Quoth he, ""I cannot walk a single step for weakness."" Quoth Kanmakan, ""If the case be thus we will get us two horses and ride forth, I and thou, and seek the open."" So he did as he said, and he took horse with Sasan and rode till day break, when they prayed the dawn prayer and fared on, and ceased not faring till they came to a garden, where they sat down and talked. Then Kanmakan rose to Sasan and said, ""Is aught left to set thy heart against me?"" ""No, by Allah!"" replied Sasan. So they agreed to return to Baghdad and Sabbah the Badawi said, ""I will go before you, to give folk the fair tidings of your coming."" Then he rode on in advance, acquainting women and men with the good news; so all the people came out to meet Kanmakan with tabrets and pipes; and Kuzia Fakan also came out, like the full moon shining in all her splendour of light through the thick darkness of the night. So Kanmakan met her, and soul yearned to soul and body longed for body. There was no talk among the people of the time but of Kanmakan; for the Knights bore witness of him that he was the most valiant of the folk of the age and said, ""It is not right that other than Kanmakan should be our Sultan, but the throne of his grandfather shall revert to him as it began."" Meanwhile Sasan went in to his wife, Nuzhat al-Zaman, who said to him, ""I hear that the folk talk of nothing but Kanmakan and attribute to him such qualities as tongue never can."" He replied, ""Hearing of a man is not like seeing a man. I have seen him, but have noted in him none of the attributes of perfection. Not all that is heard is said; but folk ape one another in extolling and cherishing him, and Allah maketh his praises to run on the lips of men, so that there incline to him the hearts of the people of Baghdad and of the Wazir Dandan, that perfidious and treacherous man; who hath levied troops from all lands and taketh to himself the right of naming a King of the country; and who chooseth that it shall be under the hand of an orphan ruler whose worth is naught."" Asked Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""What then is it that thou purposest to do?""; and the King answered, ""I mean to kill him, that the Wazir may be baulked of his intent and return to his allegiance, seeing nothing for it but my service."" Quoth she, ""In good sooth perfidy with strangers is a foul thing and how much more with kith and kin! The righteous deed to do would be to marry him to thy daughter Kuzia Fakan and give heed to what was said of old time, / 'An Fate some person 'stablish o'er thy head, * /          And thou being worthier her choice upbraid, / Yet do him honour due to his estate; * /          He'll bring thee weal though far or near thou vade: / Nor speak thy thought of him, else shalt thou be * /          Of those who self degrade from honour's grade: / Many Haríms are lovelier than the Bride, * /          But Time and Fortune lent the Bride their aid.'"" / When Sasan heard these her words and comprehended what her verse intended, he rose from her in anger and said, ""Were it not that thy death would bring on me dishonour and disgrace, I would take off thy head with my blade and make an end of thy breath."" Quoth she, ""Why art thou wroth with me? I did but jest with thee."" Then she rose to him and bussed his head and hands, saying, ""Right is thy foresight, and I and thou will cast about for some means to kill him forthright."" When he heard this, he was glad and said, ""Make haste and contrive some deceit to relieve me of my grieving: for in my sooth the door of device is straitened upon me!"" Replied she, ""At once I will devise for thee to do away his life."" ""How so?"" asked he; and she answered, ""By means of our female slave the so-called Bákún."" Now this Bakun was past mistress in all kinds of knavery and was one of the most pestilent of old women, in whose religion to abstain from wickedness was not lawful; she had brought up Kuzia Fakan and Kanmakan who had her in so great affection that he used to sleep at her feet. So when King Sasan heard his wife name her, he said, ""Right is this recking""; and, sending for the old woman, told her what had passed and bade her cast about to kill Kanmaken, promising her all good. Replied she, ""Thy bidding shall be obeyed; but I would have thee, O my lord, give me a dagger[FN#106] which hath been tempered in water of death, that I may despatch him the speedilier for thee."" Quoth Sasan, ""And welcome to thee!""; and gave her a hanger that would devance man's destiny. Now this slave women had heard stories and verses and had learned by rote great store of strange sayings and anecdotes: so she took the dagger and went out of the room, considering how she could compass his doom. Then she repaired to Kanmakan, who was sitting and awaiting news of tryst with the daughter of his uncle, Kuzia Fakan; so that night his thought was taken up with her and the fires of love for her raged in his heart. And while he was thus, behold, the slave woman, Bakun, went in to him and said, ""Union time is at hand and the days of disunion are over and gone."" Now when he heard this he asked, ""How is it with Kuzia Fakan?""; and Bakun answered, ""Know that her time is wholly taken up with love of thee."" At this he rose and doffing his outer clothes put them on her and promised her all good. Then said she, ""Know that I mean to pass this night with thee, that I may tell thee what talk I have heard and console thee with stories of many passion distraughts whom love hath made sick."" ""Nay,"" quoth he, ""rather tell me a tale that will gladden my heart and gar my cares depart."" ""With joy and good will,"" answered she; then she took seat by his side (and that poniard under her dress) and began to say: ""Know thou that the pleasantest thing my ears ever heard was / Footnotes: / [ / FN#1 / ] This ""horripilation,"" for which we have the poetical term ""goose-flesh,"" is often mentioned in Hindu as in Arab literature. / [ / FN#2 / ] How often we have heard this in England! / [ / FN#3 / ] As a styptic.

""approbation,"" ""benediction""; also the Angel who keeps the Gates of Paradise and who has allowed one of the Ghilmán (or Wuldán) the boys of supernatural beauty that wait upon the Faithful, to wander forth into this wicked world. / [ / FN#15 / ] In Europe this would be a plurale majestatis, used only by Royalty. In Arabic it has no such significance, and even the lower orders apply it to themselves; although it often has a soupçon of ""I and thou."" / [ / FN#16 / ] Man being an ""extract of despicable water"" (Koran xxxii. 7) ex spermate genital), which Mr. Rodwell renders ""from germs of life,"" ""from sorry water."" / [ / FN#17 / ] i.e. begotten by man's seed in the light of salvation / (Núr al-hudá). / [ / FN#18 / ] The rolls of white (camphor-like) scarf-skin and sordes which come off under the bathman's glove become by miracle of Beauty, as brown musk. The Rubber or Shampooer is called in Egypt ""Mukayyis"" (vulgarly ""Mukayyisáti"") or ""bagman,"" from his ""Kís,"" a bag-glove of coarse woollen stuff. To ""Johnny Raws"" he never fails to show the little rolls which come off the body and prove to them how unclean they are, but the material is mostly dead scarf-skin / [ / FN#19 / ] The normal phrase on such occasions (there is always a ""dovetail"" de rigueur) ""Allah give thee profit!"" / [ / FN#20 / ] i.e. We are forced to love him only, and ignore giving him a rival (referring to Koranic denunciations of ""Shirk,"" or attributing a partner to Allah, the religion of plurality, syntheism not polytheism): see, he walks tottering under the weight of his back parts wriggling them whilst they are rounded like the revolving heavens. / [ / FN#21 / ] Jannat al-Na'ím (Garden of Delight); the fifth of the seven Paradises made of white diamond; the gardens and the plurality being borrowed from the Talmud. Mohammed's Paradise, by the by, is not a greater failure than Dante's. Only ignorance or pious fraud asserts it to be wholly sensual; and a single verse is sufficient refutation: ""Their prayer therein shall be 'Praise unto thee, O. Allah!' and their salutation therein shall be 'Peace!' and the end of their prayer shall be, 'Praise unto God, the Lord of all creatures""' (Koran x. 10-11). See also lvi. 24- 26. It will also be an intellectual condition wherein knowledge will greatly be increased (lxxxviii viii. 17-20). Moreover the Moslems, far more logical than Christians, admit into Paradise the so-called ""lower animals."" / [ / FN#22 / ] Sed vitam faciunt balnea, vine, Venus! The Hammam to Easterns is a luxury as well as a necessity; men sit there for hours talking chiefly of money and their prowess with the fair; and women pass half the day in it complaining of their husbands' over-amativeness and contrasting their own chaste and modest aversion to camel congress. / [ / FN#23 / ] The frigidarium or cold room, coolness being delightful to the Arab. / [ / FN#24 / ] The calidarium or hot room of the bath. / [ / FN#25 / ] The Angel who acts door-keeper of Hell; others say he specially presides over the torments of the damned (Koran xliii. 78). / [ / FN#26 / ] The Door-keeper of Heaven before mentioned who, like the Guebre Zamiyád has charge of the heavenly lads and lasses, and who is often charged by poets with letting them slip. / [ / FN#27 / ] Lane (i. 616), says ""of wine, milk, sherbet, or any other beverage."" Here it is wine, a practice famed in Persian poetry, especially by Hafiz, but most distasteful to a European stomach. We find the Mu allakah of Imr al-Keys noticing ""our morning draught."" Nott (Hafiz) says a ""cheerful cup of wine in the morning was a favourite indulgence with the more luxurious Persians. And it was not uncommon among the Easterns, to salute friend by saying.""May your morning potation be agreeable to you!"" In the present day this practice is confined to regular debauchees. / [ / FN#28 / ] Koran xii. 31. The words spoken by Zulaykhá's women friends and detractors whom she invited to see Beauty Joseph. / [ / FN#29 / ] A formula for averting fascination. Koran, chaps. cxiii. 1. ""Falak"" means ""cleaving"" hence the breaking forth of light from darkness, a ""wonderful instance of the Divine power."" / [ / FN#30 / ] The usual delicate chaff. / [ / FN#31 / ] Such letters are generally written on a full-sized sheet of paper (""notes"" are held slighting in the East) and folded till the breadth is reduced to about one inch. The edges are gummed, the ink, much like our Indian ink, is smeared with the finger upon the signet ring; the place where it is to be applied is slightly wetted with the tongue and the seal is stamped across the line of junction to secure privacy. I have given a specimen of an original love-letter of the kind in ""Scinde, or the Unhappy Valley,"" chaps. iv. / [ / FN#32 / ] Arab. ""Salb"" which may also mean hanging, but the usual term for the latter in The Nights is ""shanak."" Crucifixion, abolished by the superstitious Constantine, was practised as a servile punishment as late as the days of Mohammed Ali Pasha the Great e malefactors were nailed and tied to the patibulum or cross-piece without any sup pedaneum or foot-rest and left to suffer tortures from flies and sun, thirst and hunger. They often lived three days and died of the wounds mortifying and the nervous exhaustion brought on by cramps and convulsions. In many cases the corpses were left to feed the kites and crows; and this added horror to the death. Moslems care little for mere hanging. Whenever a fanatical atrocity is to be punished, the malefactor should be hung in pig-skin, his body burnt and the ashes publicly thrown into a common cesspool. / [ / FN#33 / ] Arab ""Shaytán"" the insolent or rebellious one is a common / term of abuse. The word I. Koramc, and borrowed as usual from the / Jews. ""Satan"" occurs four times in the O.T. of which two are in / Job where, however, he is a subordinate angel. / [ / FN#34 / ] Arab. ""Alak"" from the Koran xxii. 5. "" O men…consider that we first created you of dust (Adam); afterwards of seed (Rodwell's ""moist germs of life""); afterwards of a little coagulated (or clots of) blood."" It refers to all mankind except Adam, Eve and Isa. Also chaps. xcvi. 2, which, as has been said was probably the first composed at Meccah. Mr. Rodwell (v. 10) translates by 'Servant of God"" what should be ""Slave of Allah,"" alluding to Mohammed's original name Abdullah. See my learned friend Aloys Sprenger, Leben, etc., i.155. / [ / FN#35 / ] The Hindus similarly exaggerate: ""He was ready to leap out of his skin in his delight"" (Katha, etc., p. 443). / [ / FN#36 / ] A star in the tail of the Great Bear, one of the ""Banát al-Na'ash,"" or a star close to the second. Its principal use is to act foil to bright Sohayl (Canopus) as in the beginning of Jámí's Layla-Majnún:— /          To whom Thou'rt hid, day is darksome night: /          To whom shown, Sohá as Sohayl is bright. / See also al-Hariri (xxxii. and xxxvi.). The saying, ""I show her Soha and she shows me the moon"" (A. P. i. 547) arose as follows. In the Ignorance a beautiful Amazon defied any man to take her maidenhead; and a certain Ibn al-Ghazz won the game by struggling with her till she was nearly senseless. He then asked her, ""How is thine eye-sight: dost thou see Soha?"" and she, in her confusion, pointed to the moon and said, ""That is it!"" / [ / FN#37 / ] The moon being masculine (lupus) and the sun feminine. / [ / FN#38 / ] The ""five Shaykhs"" must allude to that number of Saints whose names are doubtful; it would be vain to offer conjectures. Lane and his ""Sheykh"" (i. 617) have tried and failed. / [ / FN#39 / ] The beauties of nature seem always to provoke hunger in / Orientals, especially Turks, as good news in Englishmen. / [ / FN#40 / ] Pers. ""Lájuward"": Arab. ""Lázuward""; prob. the origin of our ""azure,"" through the Romaic and the Ital. azzurro; and, more evidently still, of lapis lazuli, for which do not see the Dictionaries. / [ / FN#41 / ] Arab. ""Maurid."" the desert-wells where caravans drink: also the way to water wells. / [ / FN#42 / ] The famous Avicenna, whom the Hebrews called Aben Sina. The early European Arabists, who seem to have learned Arabic through Hebrew, borrowed their corruption, and it long kept its place in Southern Europe. / [ / FN#43 / ] According to the Hindus there are ten stages of love- sickness: (1) Love of the eyes (2) Attraction of the Manas or mind; (3) Birth of desire; (4) Loss of sleep; (5) Loss of flesh; (6) Indifference to objects of sense; (7) Loss of shame, (8) Distraction of thought (9) Loss of consciousness; and (10) Death. / [ / FN#44 / ] We should call this walk of ""Arab ladies"" a waddle: I have never seen it in Europe except amongst the trading classes of Trieste, who have a ""wriggle"" of their own. / [ / FN#45 / ] In our idiom six doors. / [ / FN#46 / ] They refrained from the highest enjoyment, intending to marry. / [ / FN#47 / ] Arab. ""Jihád,"" lit. fighting against something; Koranically, fighting against infidels non- believers in Al-lslam (chaps. Ix. 1). But the ""Mujáhidún"" who wage such war are forbidden to act aggressively (ii. 186). Here it is a war to save a son. / [ / FN#48 / ] The lady proposing extreme measures is characteristic: Egyptians hold, and justly enough, that their women are more amorous than men. / [ / FN#49 / ] ""O Camphor,"" an antiphrase before noticed. The vulgar also say ""Yá Taljí""=O snowy (our snowball), the polite ""Ya Abú Sumrah !"" =O father of brownness. / [ / FN#50 / ] i.e. which fit into sockets in the threshold and lintel and act as hinges. These hinges have caused many disputes about how they were fixed, for instance in caverns without moveable lintel or threshold. But one may observe that the upper projections are longer than the lower and that the door never fits close above, so by lifting it up the inferior pins are taken out of the holes. It is the oldest form and the only form known to the Ancients. In Egyptian the hinge is called Akab=the heel, hence the proverb Wakaf' al-báb alá 'akabin; the door standeth on its heel; i.e. every thing in proper place. / [ / FN#51 / ] Hence the addresses to the Deity: Yá Sátir and Yá Sattár- -Thou who veilest the sins of Thy Servants! said e.g., when a woman is falling from her donkey, etc. / [ / FN#52 / ] A necessary precaution, for the headsman who would certainly lose his own head by overhaste. / [ / FN#53 / ] The passage has also been rendered, ""and rejoiced him by what he said"" (Lane i, 600). / [ / FN#54 / ] Arab. ""Hurr""=noble, independent (opp. to 'Abd=a servile) often used to express animæ nobilitas as in Acts xvii. 11; where the Berans were ""more noble"" than the Thessalonians. The Princess means that the Prince would not lie with her before marriage. / [ / FN#55 / ] The Persian word is now naturalized as Anglo-Egypeian. / [ / FN#56 / ] Arab. ""khassat hu"" = removed his testicles, gelded him. / [ / FN#57 / ] Here ends the compound tale of Taj al-Muluk cum Aziz plus / Azizah, and we return to the history of King Omar's sons. / [ / FN#58 / ] ""Zibl"" popularly pronounced Zabal, means ""dung."" Khan is ""Chief,"" as has been noticed; ""Zabbál,"" which Torrens renders literally ""dung-drawer,"" is one who feeds the Hammam with bois- de-vache, etc. / [ / FN#59 / ] i.e one who fights the Jihád or ""Holy War"": it is equivalent to our ""good knight."" / [ / FN#60 / ] Arab. ""Malik."" Azud al Daulah, a Sultan or regent under the Abbaside Caliph Al-Tá'i li 'llah (regn. A.H. 363-381) was the first to take the title of ""Malik."" The latter in poetry is still written Malík. / [ / FN#61 / ] A townlet on the Euphrates, in the ""awwal Shám,"" or frontier of Syria. / [ / FN#62 / ] i.e., the son would look to that. / [ / FN#63 / ] A characteristic touch of Arab pathos, tender and true. / [ / FN#64 / ] Arab. ""Mawarid"" from ""ward"" = resorting to pool or water- pit (like those of ""Gakdúl"") for drinking, as opposed to ""Sadr""=returning after having drunk at it. Hence the ""Sádir"" (part. act.) takes precedence of the ""Wárid"" in Al-Hariri (Ass. of the Badawi). / [ / FN#65 / ] One of the fountains of Paradise (Koran, chaps. Ixxvi.): the word lit. means ""water flowing pleasantly down the throat."" The same chapter mentions ""Zanjabíl,"" or the Ginger-fount, which to the Infidel mind unpleasantly suggests ""ginger pop."" / [ / FN#66 / ] Arab. ""Takhíl"" = adorning with Kohl. / [ / FN#67 / ] The allusions are far-fetched and obscure as in Scandinavian poetry. Mr. Payne (ii. 314) translates ""Naml"" by ""net."" I understand the ant (swarm) creeping up the cheeks, a common simile for a young beard. The lovers are in the Lazá (hell) of jealousy etc., yet feel in the Na'ím (heaven) of love and robe in green, the hue of hope, each expecting to be the favoured one. / [ / FN#68 / ] Arab. ""Ukhuwán,"" the classical term. There are two chamomiles, the white (Bábúnaj) and the yellow (Kaysún), these however are Syrian names and plants are differently called in almost every Province of Arabia / [ / FN#69 / ] In nomadic life the parting of lovers happens so frequently that it become. a stock topic in poetry and often, as here, the lover complains of parting when he is not parted. But the gravamen lies in the word ""Wasl"" which may mean union, meeting, reunion Or coition. As Ka'ab ibn Zuhayr began his famous poem with ""Su'ád hath departed,"" 900 imitators (says Al-Siyuti) adopted the Násib or address to the beloved and Su'ad came to signify a cruel, capricious mistress. / [ / FN#70 / ] As might be expected from a nation of camel-breeders actual cautery which can cause only counter-irritation, is a favourite nostrum; and the Hadis or prophetic saying is ""Akhir al-dawá (or al-tibb) al-Kayy"" = cautery is the end of medicine- cure; and ""Fire and sickness cannot cohabit."" Most of the Badawi bear upon their bodies grisly marks Of this heroic treatment, whose abuse not unfrequently brings on gangrene. The Hadis (Burckhardt, Proverbs, No. 30) also means ""if nothing else avail, take violent measures. / [ / FN#71 / ] The Spaniards have the same expression: ""Man is fire and woman is tinder."" / [ / FN#72 / ] Arab. ""Báshik"" from Persian ""Báshah"" (accipiter Nisus) a fierce little species of sparrow-hawk which I have described in ""Falconry in the Valley of the Indus"" (p. 14, etc.). / [ / FN#73 / ] Lit. ""Coals (fit) for frying pan."" / [ / FN#74 / ] Arab. ""Libdah,"" the sign of a pauper or religious mendicant. He is addressed ""Yá Abu libdah!"" (O father of a felt calotte!) / [ / FN#75 / ] In times of mourning Moslem women do not use perfumes or dyes, like the Henna here alluded to in the pink legs and feet of the dove. / [ / FN#76 / ] Koran, chaps. ii. 23. The idea is repeated in some forty / Koranic passages. / [ / FN#77 / ] A woman's name, often occurring. The ""daughters of Sa'ada"" are zebras, so called because ""they resemble women in beauty and graceful agility."" / [ / FN#78 / ] Arab. ""Tiryák"" from Gr. a drug against venomous bites. It was compounded mainly of treacle, and that of Baghdad and Irák was long held sovereign. The European equivalent, ""Venice treacle,"" (Theriaca Andromachi) is an electuary containing many elements. Badawin eat for counter- poison three heads of garlic in clarified butter for forty days. (Pilgrimage iii 77 ) / [ / FN#79 / ] Could Cervantes have read this? In Algiers he might easily have heard it recited by the tale-tellers. Kanmakan is the typical Arab Knight, gentle and valiant as Don Quixote Sabbáh is the Grazioso, a ""Beduin"" Sancho Panza. In the ""Romance of Antar"" we have a similar contrast with Ocab who says: ""Indeed I am no fighter: the sword in my hand-palm chases only pelicans ;"" and, ""whenever you kill a satrap, I'll plunder him."" / [ / FN#80 / ] i.e. The Comely, son of the Spearman, son of the Lion, or / Hero. / [ / FN#81 / ] Arab. ""Ushári."" Old Purchas (vi., i. 9) says there are three kinds of camels (1 ) Huguin (=Hejin) of tall stature and able to carry 1,000 lbs. (2) Bechete (=Bukhti) the two-humped Bactrian before mentioned and, (3) the Raguahill (Rahíl) small dromedaries unfit for burden but able to cover a hundred miles in a day. The ""King of Timbukhtu"" (not ""Bukhtu's well"" pop. Timbuctoo) had camels which reach Segelmesse (Sijalmas) or Darha, nine hundred miles in eight days at most. Lyon makes the Maherry (also called El-Heirie=Mahri) trot nine miles an hour for a long time. Other travellers in North Africa report the Sabayee (Saba'i=seven days weeder) as able to get over six hundred and thirty miles (or thirty-five caravan stages=each eighteen miles) in five to seven days. One of the dromedaries in the ""hamlah"" or caravan of Mr. Ensor (Journey through Nubia and Darfoor—a charming book) travelled one thousand one hundred and ten miles in twenty- seven days. He notes that his beasts were better with water every five to seven days, but in the cold season could do without drink for sixteen. I found in Al-Hijaz at the end of August that the camels suffered much after ninety hours without drink (Pilgrimage iii. 14). But these were ""Júdi"" fine-haired animals as opposed to ""Khawár"" (the Khowás of Chesney, p. 333), coarse-haired, heavy, slow brutes which will not stand great heat. / [ / FN#82 / ] i.e. Fortune so willed it (euphemistically). / [ / FN#83 / ] The ""minaret"" being feminine is usually compared with a fair young girl. The oldest minaret proper is supposed to have been built in Damascus by the Ommiade Caliph (No. X.) Al-Walid A.H. 86-96 (=705-715). According to Ainsworth (ii. 113) the second was at Kuch Hisar in Chaldea. / [ / FN#84 / ] None of the pure Badawi can swim for the best of reasons, want of waters. / [ / FN#85 / ] The baser sort of Badawi is never to be trusted: he is a traitor born, and looks upon fair play as folly or cowardice. Neither oath nor kindness can bind him: he unites the cruelty of the cat with the wildness of the wolf. How many Englishmen have lost their lives by not knowing these elementary truths! The race has not changed from the days of Mandeville (A.D. 1322) whose ""Arabians, who are called Bedouins and Ascopards (?), are right felonious and foul, and of a cursed nature."" In his day they ""carried but one shield and one spear, without other arm :"" now, unhappily for travellers, they have matchlocks and most tribes can manufacture a something called by courtesy gunpowder. / [ / FN#86 / ] Thus by Arab custom they become friends. / [ / FN#87 / ] Our classical term for a noble Arab horse. / [ / FN#88 / ] In Arab. ""Khayl"" is=horse; Husan, a stallion; Hudúd, a brood stallion; Faras, a mare (but sometimes used as a horse and meaning ""that tears over the ground""), Jiyád a steed (noble); Kadísh, a nag (ignoble); Mohr a colt and Mohrah, a filly. There are dozens of other names but these suffice for conversation / [ / FN#89 / ] Al-Katúl, the slayer; Al-Majnún, the mad; both high compliments in the style inverted. / [ / FN#90 / ] This was a highly honourable exploit, which would bring the doer fame as well as gain. / [ / FN#91 / ] This is a true and life-like description of horse- stealing in the Desert: Antar and Burckhardt will confirm every word. A noble Arab stallion is supposed to fight for his rider and to wake him at night if he see any sign of danger. The owner generally sleeps under the belly of the beast which keeps eyes and ears alert till dawn. / [ / FN#92 / ] Arab. ""Yaum al tanádi,"" i.e. Resurrection-day. / [ / FN#93 / ] Arab. ""Bilád al-Súdan""=the Land of the Blacks, negro- land, whence the slaves came, a word now fatally familiar to English ears. There are, however, two regions of the same name, the Eastern upon the Upper Nile and the Western which contains the Niger Valley, and each considers itself the Sudan. And the reader must not confound the Berber of the Upper Nile, the Berderino who acts servant in Lower Egypt, with the Berber of Barbary: the former speaks an African language; the latter a ""Semitic"" (Arabic) tongue. / [ / FN#94 / ] ""Him"" for ""her."" / [ / FN#95 / ] Arab. ""Sáibah,"" a she-camel freed from labour under certain conditions amongst the pagan Arabs; for which see Sale (Prel. Disc. sect. v.). / [ / FN#96 / ] Arab. ""Marba'."" In early spring the Badawi tribes leave the Rasm or wintering-place (the Turco-Persian ""Kishlák"") in the desert, where winter-rains supply them, and make for the Yaylák, or summer-quarters, where they find grass and water. Thus the great Ruwala tribe appears regularly every year on the eastern slopes of the Anti-Libanus (Unexplored Syria, i. 117), and hence the frequent ""partings."" / [ / FN#97 / ] This ""renowning it"" and boasting of one's tribe (and oneself) before battle is as natural as the war-cry: both are intended to frighten the foe and have often succeeded. Every classical reader knows that the former practice dates from the earliest ages. It is still customary in Arabia during the furious tribal fights, the duello on a magnificent scale which often ends in half the combatants on either side being placed hors-de- combat. A fair specimen of ""renowning it"" is Amrú's Suspended Poem with its extravagant panegyric of the Taghlab tribe (p. 64, ""Arabian Poetry for English Readers,"" etc., by W. A. Clouston, Glasgow: privately printed MDCCCLXXXI.; and transcribed from Sir William Jones's translation). / [ / FN#98 / ] The ""Turk"" appeared soon amongst the Abbaside Caliphs. Mohammed was made to prophecy of them under the title Banú Kantúrah, the latter being a slave-girl of Abraham. The Imam Al- Shafi'i (A.H. 195=A.D. 810) is said to have foretold their rule in Egypt where an Ottoman defended him against a donkey-boy. (For details see Pilgrimage i. 216 ) The Caliph Al-Mu'atasim bi'llah (A.D. 833-842) had more than 10,000 Turkish slaves and was the first to entrust them with high office; so his Arab subjects wrote of him:— / A wretched Turk is thy heart's desire; / And to them thou showest thee dam and sire. / His successor Al-Wásik (Vathek, of the terrible eyes) was the first to appoint a Turk his Sultan or regent. After his reign they became praetorians and led to the downfall of the Abbasides. / [ / FN#99 / ] The Persian saying is ""First at the feast and last at the fray."" / [ / FN#100 / ] i.e. a tempter, a seducer. / [ / FN#101 / ] Arab. ""Wayl-ak"" here probably used in the sense of / ""Wayh-ak"" an expression of affectionate concern. / [ / FN#102 / ] Firdausi, the Homer of Persia, affects the same magnificent exaggeration. The trampling of men and horses raises such a dust that it takes one layer (of the seven) from earth and adds it to the (seven of the) Heavens. The ""blaze"" on the stallion's forehead (Arab. ""Ghurrah"") is the white gleam of the morning. / [ / FN#103 / ] A noted sign of excitement in the Arab blood horse, when the tail looks like a panache covering the hind-quarter. / [ / FN#104 / ] i.e. Prince Kanmakan. / [ / FN#105 / ] The ""quality of mercy"" belongs to the noble Arab, whereas the ignoble and the Bada win are rancorous and revengeful as camels. / [ / FN#106 / ] Arab.

The  / Visit Mississippi website /  describes the state as ""the birthplace of America's music"", a reference to delta blues.  The state also claims its native son Jimmie Rodgers is the  / ""father of country music"" / .  Whether you agree with those claims or not, you'd be hard-pressed to find a state with a longer list of musical talent.  Before you go to the list though, let's discuss the musical genres where Mississippi artists have made the biggest contributions / . / Delta Blues / Historians are still divided on this, but there's a good argument that blues music was born in the Mississippi Delta, an outgrowth of slave songs, work chants and field hollers used there for hundreds of years / . / As early as the American Civil War, white soldiers noted a different music created by black soldiers. They were still songs about marching, fighting and longing for home, but they were different; they were more personal and they seemed ad-libbed. Those call and response songs, blended with the spirituals that came from the slaves, were the direct ancestors of the blues / . / Delta blues has a rhythmic style and features strong vocals. The lyrics are usually simple and use repeated lines. The subjects tend to be personal and often reflect the hard life of the African-American farmer in the delta.  Considered by many to be the most influential of the blues music styles, delta blues originated in the Mississippi Delta region in the last decades of the 19th century. By the 1890s, the 12 bar blues format was set and blues music was heard from work camps to road houses / . / -  / The regions of Mississippi / Blues songs were passed from one performer to another, and many artists added new lyrics to an old song to make the song  their own. There were no copyrights, no printed sheet music and no recordings.  / There are dozens of blues artists we'll never know about. /  But things started to change around the turn of the 20th century. Blues music was becoming more widely popular and blues songs started to appear as sheet music / . / One of the most influential of all the early bluesmen was  / Charley Patton / .  Born in Hinds County, Mississippi, he lived most of his life in Sunflower County (the home of  / Parchman Farm Penitentiary /  and the place sung about in  / the song of the same name / ). Patton was born sometime between 1881 and 1891, the son of Bill and Annie Patton.  In 1900, his family moved  to the Dockery Plantation near Ruleville, Mississippi / . / Charley was already playing blues music and it's there that Robert Johnson, Willie Brown, John Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf became disciples.  They'd work the fields and they'd played on the porch after dinner. If they were lucky, they got a paying gig in a saloon / . / These are the guys that defined blues music for us, and their teacher was Charley Patton.  His music exists today only as scratchy,  / nearly indecipherable recordings /  - unlistenable really.  But there's a sad soulfulness in what's left. That mournful sound, and the stories his associates have told, make you realize the lineage of this music  / has /  to go back a very long, painful way.  Is it any wonder Willie Brown came up with the lover's plea in  / ""Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor"" / ? Could the regret and sorrow in Son House's voice  in   / ""Death Letter Blues"" /  be any more real? / But not all of the music is about pain. Many of these songs are filled with fun and good humor.  B.B. King displays that with  / ""Better Not Look Down"" /  and  / ""Sitting on Top of the World"" / . Ry Cooder, John Logan and Nathan East go to it in  / ""Willie Brown Blues"" / . Big Joe Turner gives us sex  / and humor /  in the jump blues song,  / ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" / . Along those same lines, Walter Davis, from Grenada, Mississippi, wrote a song called  / ""I Can Tell by the Way You Smell"" / , and Cooder gives us a great arrangement of it.  Finally, John Lee Hooker explains what it means to be young and free in  / ""Boogie Chillen'"" / . / So, following the thought from William Faulkner mentioned at the beginning of this article, to understand the blues, you have to wrap your head around the cumulative effect of 300 years of human slavery, Klu Klux Klan and  / Jim Crow laws / . / - / The Poor Monkey Lounge is a juke joint sitting in a cotton field, four miles west of Merigold, Mississippi / . / The Robert Johnson Mythology / The legend associated with Johnson is that he made a deal with the devil -  / he traded his soul for mastery of the blues guitar / . The legend developed over time, and it starts with Johnson's song,  / ""Cross Road Blues"" / .   / It's unlikely that Johnson was trying to create a mythology around himself when he wrote it, but over time these things develop a life of their own. /   It started with interpretations of the song after Johnson's death in 1938. But the part about the pact with the devil who took the form of a mysterious black man was added later when someone saw the similarities to the German legend of  / Faust / . Johnson's renewed popularity in the 1960s resulted in the addition of the melodramatic midnight hour and the cross roads meeting location. By the 1980s, the story had taken on a life of its own with the movie,  / Crossroads /   and this brilliant  / interpretation of Johnson's song by Ry Cooder. / . / Blues Instrumentation / ""The Mississippi Delta was shining like a National Guitar"" / - Paul Simon / The banjo, acoustic guitar and harmonica were the original instruments of the blues, but the banjo fell out of favor by the end of the 19th century. The metal or glass slide gave the guitar new life, and the steel resonator guitar introduced in the 1920s  added more volume and a distinct new sound.   / The electric guitar arrived in the 1930s and that changed everything. /  It was first used in blues music by  / T-Bone Walker /  in the 1930s,  and he recorded one of the first electric blues songs,  / ""Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just As Bad)"" /  in 1943. He was followed by  / John Lee Hooker / ,  / B.B. King /  and  / Muddy Waters /  in the 1940s. Their styles respectively developed into  / Detroit blues / ,  / Chicago blues /  and   / West Coast blues / . / Hill Country Blues / Mississippi hill country is its own distinct part of the state.  For the most part, it lies east of Interstate 55.  The hill country isn't really hilly, but compared to the flat pan of the delta it sure is, and it has lots of cotton fields. Hill country blues is different too. There's a resigned sadness to it, and it has a haunting, uncanny sound about it, That droning, single-chord groove is its most notable characteristic / . / Although these acts aren't from Mississippi, the Steel Drivers capture the sound of Hill Country Blues in  / ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" / , while Bobbie King and Terry Evans also get it with  / ""Down in Mississippi"" / . / R.L Burnside from Harmontown, Mississippi knows it because he grew up with it. He does a hill country version of  / ""Rollin and Tumblin"" /  and  / ""Skinny Woman"" / . His grandson, Cedric Burnside shows his chops in  / ""Tell Me What I'm Gonna Do"" /  and Junior Kimbrough from Hudsonville, Mississippi does it with  / ""You Better Run"" /  and  / ""Lonesome Road"" / . / Southern Rock / Southern Rock may have one foot in the blues and the other foot in country music, but it sure got its hips from  / Elvis Presley / . The King shows us where it all comes from with  / ""That's All Right, Mama"" / ,  / ""Blue Suede Shoes"" / ,     / ""Heartbreak Hotel"" /  and  / ""(You're the) Devil in Disguise"" / . / You'll hear that southern charm and humor in The North Mississippi Allstars'  / ""Shake 'Em On Down"" / .  John Murry, the second cousin of William Faulkner, gives us something completely different with  / ""Ballad of the Pajama Kid"" /  and even if she isn't from Mississippi, you'll hear southern humor in Susan Tedeschi's  / ""Rock Me Right"" / . / Country and Country Rock / In Mississippi, Country music starts with Jimmie Rodgers. He taught himself to play the guitar and learned to sing in church. He worked as a waterboy in the railroad yards, learning folk and blues songs from the men working there. You can hear those influences in his songs,  / ""In the Jailhouse Now"" / ,  / ""T is for Texas"" /  and  / ""Muleskinner Blues"" / . / Jimmy Buffet from Pascagoula shows us there's more to the state than just the blues with  / ""Why Don't We Get Drunk (and Screw)"" /  and  / ""Ringling, Ringling"" / .  LeAnn Rimes from Jackson shows style in  / ""Swingin'"" / . Faith Hill from Ridgeland shows another side of the state with  / ""Mississippi Girl"" /  and  / ""Wild One"" / .

Been Too Long On The Road,Mark Lindsay,"[{""chart_position"": 98, ""chart_date"": ""1971-06-12""}]",1,98,98,"""This is what I call satisfactory,"" said Bill, as they sat at breakfast next morning. ""It's a great relief to the mind to know that them puddin'-thieves is sufferin' the agonies of remorse, and that our Puddin' is safe from bein' stolen every ten minutes."" / ""You're a bun-headed old optimist,"" said the Puddin' rudely. ""Puddin'-thieves never suffer from remorse. They only suffer from blighted hopes and suppressed activity."" / ""Have you no trust in human nature, Albert?"" asked Bill, sternly. ""Don't you know that nothin' gives a man greater remorse than havin' his face punched, his toes trod on, and eggs rubbed in his hair?"" / ""I have grave doubts myself,"" said Bunyip Bluegum, ""as to the sincerity of their repentance; ""and Ben Brandysnap said that, speaking as a market gardener, his experience of carrot catchers, onion snatchers, pumpkin pouncers, and cabbage grabbers induced him to hold the opinion that shooting them with pea-rifles was the only sure way to make them feel remorse. / In fact as Sam said:— / The howls and groans of pain and grief, / The accents of remorse, / Extracted from a puddin'-thief / Are all put on, of course."" / ""Then, all I can say is,"" cried Bill, enraged, ""if there's any more of this business of puddin'-thieves, disguised as firemen, stealing our Puddin', and puddin'-thieves, not disguised at all, shovin' bags over our heads, blow me if I don't give up Puddin'-owning in despair and take to keepin' carrots for a livin'."" / The Puddin' was so furious at this remark that they were forced to eat an extra slice all round to pacify him, in spite of which he called Bill a turnip-headed old carrot-cruncher, and other insulting names. However, at length they set out on the road, Bill continuing to air some very despondent remarks. / ""For what is the good of havin' a noble trustin' nature,"" said he, ""for every low puddin'-thief in the land to take advantage of? As far as I can see, the only thing to do is to punch every snout we meet, and chance the odds it belongs to a puddin'-thief."" / ""Come,"" said Bunyip Bluegum, ""I see you are not your wonted, good-humoured self this morning. As a means of promoting the general gaiety, I call on you to sing ""The Salt Junk Sarah"" without delay."" / This was immediately effective, and Bill with the greatest heartiness roared out: / ""Ho, aboard the Salt Junk Sarah / Rollin' round the ocean wide, / The bo'sun's mate, I grieve to state, / He kissed the bo'sun's bride.Rollin' home, rollin' home, / Home across the foam; / The bo'sun rose and punched his nose / And banged him on the dome."" / At about the fifteenth verse they came to the town of Tooraloo, and that put a stop to the singing, because you can't sing in the public streets unless you are a musician or a nuisance. The town of Tooraloo is one of those dozing, snoozing, sausage-shaped places where all the people who aren't asleep are only half awake, and where dogs pass away their lives on the footpaths, and you fall over cows when taking your evening stroll. / There was a surprise awaiting them at Tooraloo, for the moment they arrived two persons in  / bell-toppers /  and long-tailed coats ran out from behind a fence and fell flat on their backs in the middle of the road, yelling ""Help, help! thieves and ruffians are at work!"" / The travellers naturally stared with amazement at this peculiar conduct. The moment the persons in bell-toppers caught sight of them they sprang up, and striking an attitude expressive of horror, shouted: / ""Behold the puddin'-thieves!"" / ""Behold the what?"" exclaimed Bill. / ""Puddin'-thieves,"" said one of the bell-topperers. ""For well you know that that dear Puddin' in your hand has been stolen from its parents and guardians which is ourselves."" And the other bell- topperer added, ""Deny it not, for with that dear Puddin' in your hand your guilt is manifest."" / ""Well, if this ain't enough to dumbfound a codfish,"" exclaimed Bill. ""Here's two total strangers, disguised as undertakers, actually accusin' us of stealin' our own Puddin'. Why, it's outside the bounds of comprehension!"" / ""It's enough to stagger the senses,"" said Sam. / ""It's enough to daze the mind with horror,"" said Bill. / ""Come, come,"" said the bell-topperers, ""cease these expressions of amazement and hand over the stolen Puddin'."" / ""What d' yer mean,"" exclaimed Bill, ""by callin' this a stolen Puddin'? It's a respectable steak-and-kidney, apple-dumplin', grand digestive Puddin', and any fellers in pot-hats sayin' it's a stolen Puddin' is scoundrels of the deepest dye.""""Never use such words to people wearing bell-toppers,"" said one of the bell-topperers, and the other added, ""With that dear Puddin' gazing up to heaven, how can you use such words?"" / ""All very fine, no doubt,"" sneered Bill, ""but if you ain't scoundrels of the deepest dye, remove them hats and prove you ain't afraid to look us in the eye."" / ""No, no,"" said the first bell-topperer. ""No removing hats at present on account of sunstroke, and colds in the head, and doctor's orders. My doctor said to me only this morning, 'Never remove your hat.' Those were his words. 'Let it be your rule through life,' he said, 'to keep the head warm, whatever happens.'"" / ""No singing `God save the King,' neither,"" said the other belltopperer. ""Let your conduct be noble, and never sing the National Anthem to people wearing bell-toppers."" / ""In fact,"" said the first bell-topperer, ""All we say is, Hand over the Puddin' with a few well-chosen words, and all ill-feeling will be dropped."" / Bill was so enraged at this suggestion that he dashed his hat on the ground and kicked it to relieve his feelings. ""Law or no law,"" he shouted, ""I call on all hands to knock them bell-toppers off."" / All hands made a rush for the bell-topperers, who shouted, ""An Englishman's hat is his castle,"" and ""Top-hats are sacred things;"" but they were overpowered by numbers, and their hats were snatched off. ""THE PUDDIN'-THIEVES!"" shouted the company. / Those bell-toppers had disguised that snooting, snouting scoundrel, the Possum, and his snoozing, boozing friend the Wombat! There was an immense uproar over this discovery, Bill and Sam flapping and snout-bending away at the puddin'-thieves, the puddin'thieves roaring for mercy. Ben denounced them as bag snatchers, and Bunyip Bluegum expressed his indignation in a fine burst of oratory, beginning: / ""Base, indeed, must be those scoundrels, who, lost to all sense of decency and honour, boldly assume the outward semblance of worthy citizens, and, by the pretentious nature of their appearance, not only seek the better to impose upon the noble incredulity of Puddin'-owners, but, with dastardly cunning, strike a blow at Society's most sacred emblem-the pot-hat."" / The uproar brought the Mayor of Tooraloo hastening to the scene, followed by the local constable. The Mayor was a little, fat, breathless, beetle-shaped man, who hastened with difficulty owing to his robe of office being trodden on by the Constable, who ran close behind him in order to finish eating a banana in secret. He had some more bananas in a paper bag, and his face was one of those feeble faces that make one think of eggs and carrots and feathers, if you take my meaning. / ""How now, how now!"" shouted the Mayor. ""A riot going on here, a disturbance in the town of Tooraloo. Constable, arrest these rioters and disturbers."" / ""Before going to extremes,"" said the Constable, in a tremulous voice, ""my advice to you is,  / read the Riot Act, /  and so have all the honour and glory of stopping the riot yourself."" / ""Unfortunately,"" said the Mayor, ""in the haste of departure, I forgot to bring the Riot Act, so there's nothing else for it; you must have all the honour and glory of quelling it.""""The trouble is,"" said the Constable, ""that there are far too manyrioters. One would have been quite sufficient. If there had been only one small undersized rioter, I should have quelled him with the utmost severity."" / ""Constable,"" said the Mayor, sternly, ""in the name of His Majesty the King I call on you to arrest these rioters without delay."" / ""Look here,"" said Bill, ""you're labourin' under an error. This ain't a riot at all. This is merely two puddin'-thieves gettin' a hidin' for tryin' to steal our Puddin'."" / ""Puddin'-thieves! "" exclaimed the Mayor. ""Don't tell me that puddin'-thieves have come to Tooraloo. / ""It staggers me with pain and grief, / I can't believe it's true, / That we should have a puddin'-thief / Or two in Tooraloo. / ""It is enough to make one dumb / And very pale in hue / To know that puddin'-thieves should come / To sacred Tooraloo. / ""The Law's just anger must appear. / Ho! seize these scoundrels who / Pollute the moral atmosphere / Of rural Tooraloo."" / ""We protest against these cruel words,"" said the Possum. ""We have been assaulted and battered and snout-bended by ruffians of the worst description."" / ""How can Your Worship say such things,"" said the Wombat, ""and us a-wearin' bell-toppers before your very eyes."" / ""If you've been assaulted and battered,"" said the Mayor, ""we shall have to arrest the assaulters and batterers as well."" / ""What's fair to one is fair to all,"" said the Constable. ""You'll admit that, of course?"" he added to Bill. / ""I admit nothin' of the sort,"" said Bill. ""If you want to arrest anybody, do your duty and arrest these here puddin'-snatchers. / ""If you're an officer of the Law, / A constant felon-catcher, / Then do not hesitate before / A common puddin'-snatcher."" / ""We call on you to arrest these assaulters and batterers of people wearing top-hats,"" said the puddin'-thieves; / ""Our innocence let all attest, / We prove it by our hatter; / It is your duty to arrest / Not those in top-hats of the best, / But those who top-hats batter."" / ""It's very clear that somebody has to be arrested,"" said the Mayor. ""I can't be put to the trouble of wearing my robes of office in public without somebody having to pay for it. I don't care whether you arrest the top-hat batterers, or the battered top-hatterers; all I say is, do your duty, whatever happens— / ""So somebody, no matter who, / You must arrest or rue it; / As I'm the Mayor of Tooraloo, / And you've the painful job to do, / I call on you to do it."" / ""Very well,"" said the Constable, peevishly, ""as I've got to take all the responsibility, I'll settle the matter by arresting the Puddin'. As far as I can see, he's the ringleader in this disturbance."" / ""You're a carrot-nosed poltroon,"" said the Puddin' loudly. ""As for the Mayor, he's a sausage-shaped porous plaster,"" and he gave him a sharp pinch in the leg. / ""What a ferocious Puddin',"" said the Mayor, turning as pale as a turnip. ""Officer, do your duty and arrest this dangerous felon before he perpetrates further sacrilegious acts."" / ""That's all very well, you know,"" said the Constable, turning as pale as tripe; ""but he might nip me."" / ""I can't help that,"" cried the Mayor, angrily. ""At all costs I must be protected from danger. Do your duty and arrest this felon with your hat."" / The Constable looked around, gasped, and, summoning all his courage, scooped up the Puddin' in his hat. / ""My word,"" he said, breathlessly, ""but that was a narrow squeak. I expected every moment to be my last."" / ""Now we breathe more freely,"" said the Mayor, and led the way to the Tooraloo Court House. / ""If this isn't too bad,"" said Bill, furiously. ""Here we've had all the worry and trouble of fightin' puddin'-thieves night and day, and, on top of it all, here's this Tooralooral tadpole of a Mayor shovin' his nose into the business and arrestin' our Puddin' without rhyme or reason."" / As they had arrived at the Court House at that moment, Bill was forced to smother his resentment for the time being. There was nobody in Court except the Judge and the Usher, who were seated on the bench having a quiet game of cards over a bottle of port. / ""Order in the Court,"" shouted the Usher, as they all came crowding in; and the Judge, seeing the Constable carrying the Puddin' in his hat, said severely: / ""This won't do, you know; it's Contempt of Court, bringing your lunch here."" / ""An' it please you, My Lord,"" said the Constable hurriedly, ""this here Puddin' has been arrested for pinching the Mayor."" / ""As a consequence of which, I see you've pinched the Puddin',"" said the Judge facetiously. ""Dear me, what spirits I am in to-day, to be sure!"" / ""The felon has an aroma most dangerously suggestive of beef gravy,"" said the Usher, solemnly. / ""Beef gravy?"" said the Judge. ""Now, it seems to me that the aroma is much more subtly suggestive of steak and kidney."" / ""Garnished, I think, with onions,"" said the Usher. / ""In order to settle this knotty point, just hand the felon up here a moment,"" said the Judge. ""I don't suppose you've got a knife about you?"" he asked. / ""I've got a paper-knife,"" said the Usher; and, the Puddin' having been handed up to the bench, the Judge and the Usher cut a slice each, and had another glass of port. / Bill was naturally enraged at seeing total strangers eating Puddin'owners' private property, and he called out loudly: / ""Common justice and the lawful rights of Puddin'-owners."" / ""Silence in the Court while the Judge is eating,"" shouted the Usher; and the Judge said severely: / ""I really think you ought / To see I'm taking food, / So, Silence in the Court! / (I'm also taking port), / If you intrude, in manner rude, / A lesson you'll be taught."" / ""An' it please Your Lordship,"" said the Mayor, pointing to Bill, ""this person is a brutal assaulter of people wearing top-hats."" / ""No insults,"" said Bill, and he gave the Mayor a slap in the face. / The Mayor went as pale as cheese, and the Usher called out: ""No face-slapping while the Judge is dining!"" and the Judge said, angrily: / ""It's really far from nice, / As you ought to be aware, / While I am chewing a slice, / To have you slapping the Mayor. / If I have to complain of you again / I'll commit you in a trice, / You'd better take my advice; / Don't let me warn you twice."" / ""All very well for you to talk,"" said Bill, scornfully, ""sittin' up there eatin' our Puddin'. I'm a respectable Puddin'-owner, an' I calls on you to hand over that Puddin' under threat of an action-at-law for wrongful imprisonment, trespass, and illegally using the same."" / ""Personal remarks to the Judge are not allowed,"" shouted the Usher, and the Judge said solemnly: / ""A Judge must be respected, / A Judge you mustn't knock, / Or else you'll be detected / And shoved into the dock. / You'll get a nasty shock / When gaolers turn the lock. / In prison cell you'll give a yell / To hear the hangman knock."" / Here, the Usher took off his coat, as the day was warm, and hung it on the back of his chair. He then rapped on the bench and said: / ""In the name of the Law I must request / Less noise while we're having a well-earned rest. / For the Judge and the Usher never must shirk / A well-earned rest in the middle of work. / It's the duty of both they are well aware / To preserve their precious lives with care; / It's their duty, when feeling overwrought, / To preserve their lives with Puddin' and Port."" / He sat down and tossed off a bumper of port to prove his words. ""Your deal, I think,"" said the Judge, and they went on sipping and munching and dealing out cards. At this, Bill gave way to despair. / ""What on earth's to be done?"" he asked. ""Here's these legal ferrets has got our Puddin' in their clutches, and here's us, spellbound with anguish, watchin' them wolfin' it. Here's a situation as would wring groans from the breast of a boiled onion."" / ""Why it's worse than droppin' soverins down a drain,"" said Sam. / ""It's worse than catchin' your whiskers in the mangle,"" said Bill. By a fortunate chance, at this moment the Possum happened to put his snout within Bill's reach, and Bill hit it a swingeing clout to relieve his feelings. / ""It's unlawful,"" shouted the Possum, ""to hit a man's snout unexpectedly when he isn't engaged puddin'-stealing."" / ""Observe the rules,"" said the Wombat solemnly. ""Be kind to snouts when not engaged in theft."" / ""If it hadn't been for you two tryin' to steal our Puddin' all this trouble wouldn't have happened,"" said Bill. / ""It's the Mayor's fault for bringing us all here,"" cried the Possum, angrily. ""If you was a just man, you'd clout him on the snout, too."" / ""The Mayor's to blame,"" said the Wombat. ""What about the whole lot of us settin' on to him?"" / At this suggestion the Mayor trembled so violently that his hat fell off. / ""What dreadful words are these?"" he asked, and the Constable said hurriedly, ""Never set on to the Mayor while the local Constable is present. Let that be your golden rule."" / ""That's all very well,"" said Bill, ""but if you two hadn't come interferin' at the wrong moment, our Puddin' wouldn't have been arrested, and all this trouble wouldn't have happened. As you're responsible, the question now is, What are you going to do about it?"" / ""My advice is,"" said the Constable, impressively, ""resign yourselves to Fate."" / ""My advice,"" said the Mayor in a low voice, ""is general expressions of esteem and friendship, hand-shaking all round, inquiries after each other's health, chatty remarks about the weather, the price of potatoes, and how well the onions are looking."" / Bill treated these suggestions with scorn. ""If any man in the company has better advice to offer, let him stand forth,"" said he. / Bunyip Bluegum stood forth. ""My advice,"" he said, ""is this: try the case without the Judge; or, in other words, assume the legal functions of this defaulting personage in the bag-wig who is at present engaged in distending himself illegally with our Puddin'. For mark how runs the axiom: / ""If you've a case without a Judge, / It's clear your case will never budge; / But if a Judge you have to face, / The chances are you'll lose your case. / To win your case, and save your pelf, / Why, try the blooming case yourself! "" / ""As usual, our friend here solves the problem in a few well-chosen words,"" said Bill, and preparations were made at once for trying the case. After a sharp struggle, in which it was found necessary to bend the Possum's snout severely in order to make him listen to reason, the puddin'-thieves were forced into the dock. Their top-hats and frockcoats were taken away, for fear the jury might take them for undertakers, and not scoundrels. The Mayor and the Constable were pushed into the jury box to perform the duties of twelve good men and true, and the others took seats about the Court as witnesses for the prosecution. / There was some delay before the proceedings began, for Bill said, ""Here's me, the Crown Prosecutor, without a wig. This'll never do."" Fortunately, a wig was found in the Judge's private room, and Bill put it on with great satisfaction. / ""I'm afraid this is unconstitutional,"" said the Mayor to the Constable. / ""It is unconstitutional,"" said the Constable; ""but it's better than getting a punch on the snout."" / The Mayor turned so pale at this that the Constable had to thrust a banana into his mouth to restore his courage. / ""Thank you,"" said the Mayor, peevishly; "" but, on the whole, I prefer to be restored with peeled bananas."" / ""Order in the jury box,"" said Bill, sharply, and the Mayor having hurriedly bolted his banana, peel and all, proceedings commenced. / ""Gentlemen of the jury,"" said Bill, ""the case before you is one aboundin' in horror and amazement. Persons of the lowest morals has disguised themselves in pot-hats in order to decoy a Puddin' of tender years from his lawful guardians. It is related in the archives of the Noble Order of Puddin'-Owners that previous to this dastardly attempt a valuable bag, the property of Sir Benjimen Brandysnap, had been stolen and the said Puddin'-owners invited to look at a present inside it. The said bag was then pulled over their heads, compellin' the Puddin'-owners aforesaid to endure agonies of partial suffocation, let alone walkin' on each others corns for several hours. Had not Sir Benjimen, the noble owner, appeared like a guardian angel and undone the bag, it is doubtful if Sir Samuel Sawnoff's corns could have stood the strain much longer, his groans bein' such as would have brought tears to the eyes of a hard-boiled egg."" / ""A very moving story,"" said the Constable, and the Mayor was so affected that the Constable had to stuff a banana into his mouth to prevent him bursting into tears. / ""I now propose to call Sir Benjimen Brandysnap as first witness for the prosecution,"" said Bill. ""Kindly step into the witness-box, Sir Benjimen, and relate the circumstances ensuin' on your bag bein' stole."" / Benjimen stepped into the box and, taking a piece of paper from his egg basket, said solemnly: ""I was very busy that morning, Gentlemen of the jury, owing to the activity of the vegetables, as hereunder described: / ""On Tuesday morn, as it happened by chance, / The parsnips stormed in a rage, / Because the young carrots were singing like parrots / On top of the onions' cage. / ""The radishes swarmed on the angry air / Around with the bumble bees, / While the brussels-sprouts were pulling the snouts / Of all the young French peas. / ""The artichokes bounded up and down / On top of the pumpkins' heads, / And the cabbage was dancing the highland fling / All over the onion beds. / ""So I hadn't much time, as Your Honour perceives, / For watching the habits of puddin'thieves."" / ""Tut, tut, Sir Benjimen,"" said Bill, ""stir up your memory, sir; cast your eye over them felons in the dock, and tell the Court how you seen them steal the bag."" / ""The fact is,"" said Benjimen, after studying the puddin'-thieves carefully, ""as they had their backs turned to me when they were engaged in stealing the bag, I should be able to judge better if they were turned round."" / ""Officer,"" said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum, ""Kindly turn the felons' backs to the witness."" / The Possum and the Wombat objected, saying there wasn't room enough in the witness-box to turn round, so it was found necessary to twist their snouts the opposite way. / ""From this aspect,"" said Ben, ""I have no hesitation in saying that those are the backs that stole the bags."" / ""Make a note of that, Gentlemen of the jury,"" said Bill, and the Constable obligingly made a note of it on his banana bag. / ""The identity of the bag-stealers bein' now settled,"" went on Bill, ""I shall kindly ask Sir Benjimen to step down, and call on Sir Samuel Sawnoff to ascend the witness-box."" / Sam stepped up cheerfully, but, as the witness-box was the wrong size for Penguins, they had to hand him a chair to stand on. / ""Now, Sir Samuel,"" said Bill, impressively, ""I am about to ask you a most important leadin' question. Do you happen to notice such a thing as a Puddin' in the precinks of the Court?"" / Sam shaded his eyes with his flapper and, seeing the Puddin' on the bench, started back dramatically. / ""Do my eyes deceive me, or is yon object a Puddin'?"" he cried. / ""Well acted,"" said the Mayor, and the Constable clapped loudly. / ""I am now about to ask you another leadin' question,"" said Bill. ""Do you recognize that Puddin'?"" / ""Do I recognize that Puddin'?"" cried Sam in thrilling tones. ""That Puddin', sir, is dearer to me than an Uncle. That Puddin', sir, an' me has registered vows of eternal friendship and esteem. / ""That Puddin', sir, an' me have sailed the seas, / Known tropic suns, and braved the Artic breeze. / We've heard on Popocatepetl's peak / The savage Tom-Tom sharpenin' of his beak. / We've served the dreadful Jim-Jam up on toast, / When shipwrecked off the Coromandel coast, / And when we heard the frightful Bim-Bam rave, / Have plunged beneath the Salonican wave. / We've delved for Bulbuls' eggs on coral strands, / And chased the Pompeydon in distant lands. / That Puddin', sir, and me, has, back to back, / Withstood the fearful Rumty Tums' attack, / And swum the Indian Ocean for our lives, / Pursued by Oysters, armed with oyster knives. / Let me but say, e'er these adventures cloy, / I've knowed that Puddin' since he were a boy."" / ""All lies,"" sang out the Puddin', looking over the rim of his basin. ""For well you know that you and old Bill Barnacle collared me off Curry and Rice after rollin him off the iceberg."" / ""Albert, Albert,"" said Bill, sternly. ""Where's your manners interruptin' Sir Samuel in that rude way, and him a-performin' like an actor for your deliverance!"" / ""How much longer do you expect me to stay up here, bein' guzzled by these legal land-crabs?"" demanded the Puddin'. / ""You shall stay there, Albert, till the case is well and truly tried by these here noble Peers of the Realm assembled,"" said Bill, impressively. / ""Too much style about you,"" said the Puddin', rudely, and he threw the Judge's glass of port into Bill's face, remarking: ""Take that, for being a pumpkin-headed old shellback."" / There was a great uproar over this very illegal act. The Judge was enraged at losing his port, and the Mayor was filled with horror because Bill wiped his face on the mayoral hat, Sam had to feign amazement at being called a liar, and the puddin'-thieves kept shouting ""Time, time; we can't stand here all day."" / In desperation, Bill bawled at the top of his voice: ""I call on Detective Bluegum to restore order in the Court."" / Bunyip ran into the witness-box and, with a ready wit, shouted I have dreadful news to impart to this honourable Court."" / All eyes, of course, turned on Bunyip, who, raising his hand with an impressive gesture, said in thrilling tones: ""From information received, it has been discovered that the Puddin' was poisoned at ten-thirty this morning."" / This news restored order at once. The Judge turned pale as lard, and the Usher, having a darker complexion, turned as pale as soap. The Puddin' couldn't turn pale, so he let out a howl of terror. / ""Poisoned,"" said the Usher, feebly. ""How, how?"" / ""Poisoned,"" said the Judge, feeling his stomach with trembling hands. ""Until this moment I was under the delusion that a somewhat unpleasant sensation of being, as it were, distended, was merely due to having eaten seven slices. But if—"" / ""If,"" said the Usher, in a quavering voice— / ""If you take a poisoned Puddin' / And that poisoned Puddin' chew, / The sensations that you suffer / I should rather say were due / To the poison in the Puddin' / In the act of Poisoning You. / And I think the fact suffices / Through this dreadfulest of crimes, / As you've eaten seven slices / You've been poisoned seven times."" / ""It was your idea having it up on the bench,"" said the Judge, angrily, to the Usher. ""Now, / ""If what you say is true, / That idea you'll sadly rue, / The poison I have eaten is entirely due to you. / It's by taking your advice / That I've had my seventh slice, / So I'll tell you what I'll do / You unmitigated Jew, / As a trifling satisfaction, / Why, I'll beat you black and blue,"" / and with that he hit the Usher a smart crack on the head with a port bottle. / ""Don't strike a poisoned man,"" shouted the Usher; but the Judge went on smacking and cracking him with the bottle, singing— / ""The emotion of pity / Need never be sought / In a Judge who's been poisoned / By Puddin' and Port."" / In desperation, the Usher leapt off the Bench, and landed head first in the dock, where he stuck like a sardine. / ""Too bad, too bad,"" shouted the puddin'-thieves. ""Crowding in here where there's only room for two."" Before they could get rid of the Usher, the Judge bounded over the bench and commenced whacking them with the bottle, singing— / ""As I find great satisfaction / Hitting anybody who / Can offer that distraction, / Why, I'll have a go at you."" / and he went on bounding and whacking away with the bottle, while the puddin'-thieves kept roaring, and the Usher kept screaming. The uproar was deafening. / ""Just listen to it,"" said Bill, in despair. ""I'd like to know how on earth we are going to finish the case with all this umptydoodle rumpus going on."" / ""Why,"" said Bunyip, ""the simpler course is not to finish the case at all."" / ""Solved, as usual,"" said Bill and, seizing the Puddin' from the bench, he dashed out of Court, followed by Sam, Ben and Bunyip Bluegum. / As they ran, they could hear the Judge still whacking away at everybody, including the Mayor, and the Constable, whose screams were piercing. ""Indeed,"" said Bunyip— / ""I rather think they'll rather rue / The haste with which they sought to sue / Us in the Court of Tooraloo. / For, mark how just is Fate! / ""The whole benighted, blooming crew, / The Puddin'-thieves, the Usher too, / Are being beaten black and blue / With bottles on the pate. / ""I rather think they will eschew, / In future, Puddin'-owners who / Pass through the simple rural view / About the town of Tooraloo."" / ""And now,"" said Bill, when they had run a mile or two beyond the town, ""and now for some brilliant plan, swiftly conceived, which will put a stop to this Puddin'-snatchin' business for ever. For the point is,"" continued Bill, lowering his voice, ""here we are pretty close up to the end of the book, and something will have to be done in a Tremendous Hurry, or else we'll be cut off short by the cover."" / ""The solution is perfectly simple,"" said Bunyip. ""We have merely to stop wandering along the road, and the story will stop wandering through the book. This, too, will baffle the puddin' thieves, for while we wander along the road, our Puddin' is exposed to the covetous glances of every passing puddin'-snatcher. Let us, then, remove to some safe, secluded spot and settle down to a life of gaiety, dance and song, where no puddin'-thief will dare to show a sacrilegious head. Let us, in fact, build a house in a tree. For, mark the advantages of such a habitation— / ""Up on high / No neighbours pry / In at the window, / On the sly. / ""Up on high / Bricks you shy / At bores and bailiffs / Passing by. / ""Up in a tree / You're always free / From bores and bailiffs, / You'll agree. / ""Up in the leaves / One never grieves / Over the pranks / Of puddin'-thieves. / ""If you would be / Gay and free, / Take my tip and / Live in a tree."" / ""We will, we will,"" shouted the Puddin'-owners; but the Puddin' said sourly: ""This is all very well, all this high falutin'. But what about the dreadful news of me being poisoned at ten-thirty this morning?"" / ""You ain't poisoned, Albert,"" said Bill. ""That was only a mere ruse de guerre, as they say in the noosepapers."" / A what?"" demanded the Puddin', suspiciously. / ""Let words be sufficient, without explanation,"" said Bill, severely. ""And as we haven't time to waste talkin' philosophy to a Puddin', why, into the bag he goes, or we'll never get the story finished."" / So Puddin' was bundled into the bag, and Bill said, hurriedly ""Brilliant as our friend Bunyip has proved himself with his ready wit, it remains for old Bill to suggest the brightest idea of all. Here is our friend Ben, a market gardener of the finest description. Very well. Why not build our house in his market garden. The advantages are obvious. Vegetables free of charge the whole year round, and fruit in season. Eggs to be had for the askin', and a fine, simple, honest feller like Ben, to chat to of an evening. What could be more delightful?"" / Ben looked very grave at this proposal, and began: ""I very much doubt whether there will be enough bed clothes for four people, let alone the carrots are very nervous of strangers—"" when Bill cut him short with a hearty clap on the back. / ""Say no more,"" said Bill, handsomely. ""Rough, good-humoured fellers like us don't need apologies, or any social fal-lals at all. We'll take you as we find you. Without more ado, we shall build a house in your market garden."" / And, without more ado, they did. / The picture opposite saves the trouble of explaining how they built it, and what a splendid house it is. In order that the Puddin' might have plenty of exercise, they made him a little Puddin' paddock, whence he can shout rude remarks to the people passing by; a habit, I grieve to state, he is very prone to. / Of course, at night they pull up the ladder in case a stray puddin'-thief happens to be prowling around. If a friend calls to have a quiet chat, or to join in a sing-song round the fire, they let the ladder down for him. / And a very pleasant life they lead, sitting of a summer evening on the balcony while Ben does his little market-garden jobs below, and the Puddin' throws bits of bark at the cabbages, and pulls faces at the little pickle onions, in order to make them squeak with terror. / On winter nights there is always Puddin' and hot coffee for supper, and many's the good go-in I've had up there, a-sitting round the fire. I didn't mean to let on that I knew their address, on account of so many people wanting to have a go at the Puddin'. However, it's out now. / When the wind blows and the rain comes down, it's jolly sitting up aloft in the snug tree-house, especially when old Bill is in good form and gives us ""The Salt Junk Sarah"", with all hands joining in the chorus. / ""Oh, rolling round the ocean, / From a far and foreign land, / May suit the common notion / That a sailor's life is grand. / ""But as for me, I'd sooner be / A roaring here at home / About the rolling, roaring life / Of them that sails the foam. / ""For the homeward-bounder's chorus, / Which he roars across the foam, / Is all about chucking a sailor's life, / And settling down at home. / ""Home, home, home, / That's the song of them that roam, / The song of the roaring, rolling sea / Is all about rolling home.""","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'January 1, 1918', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Literature', 'Australia', ""Children's Literature""]}"

Who's the old ballocks you were talking to? / —Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders. / —What are you doing round those parts? says Joe. / —Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a  / hop-of-my-thumb /  by the name of  / Moses Herzog /  over there near Heytesbury street. / — / Circumcised? says Joe. / —Ay, says I.

An old plumber named Geraghty.  / I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him / . / —That the lay you're on now? says Joe. / —Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence.

For trading without a licence, says he. / In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings. / And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,  / York and Savoy / , and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and  / punnets /  of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe  / pomellated /  apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and  / pelurious / , and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes. / I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun. / So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink. / —There he is, says I, in his  / gloryhole / , with his  / cruiskeen lawn /  and his load of papers, working for the cause. / The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence. / —Stand and deliver, says he. / —That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here. / —Pass, friends, says he. / Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: / —What's your opinion of the times? / Doing  / the rapparee /  and  / Rory of the hill / . But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion. / —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork. / So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: / —Foreign wars is the cause of it.And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: / —It's the Russians wish to tyrannise. / —Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown. / —Give it a name, citizen, says Joe. / — / Wine of the country / , says he. / —What's yours? says Joe. / — / Ditto MacAnaspey / , says I. / —Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he. / —Never better,  / a chara / , says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh? / And with that he took the bloody old  / towser /  by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him. / The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. /  From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ( / Ulex Europeus / ). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble. / He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high  / Balbriggan buskins /  dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many  / Irish heroes and heroines /  of antiquity,  / Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles / ,  / Niall of nine hostages / ,  / Brian of Kincora / , the ardri Malachi,  / Art MacMurragh / ,  / Shane O'Neill / ,  / Father John Murphy / ,  / Owen Roe / ,  / Patrick Sarsfield / ,  / Red Hugh O'Donnell / ,  / Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone. / So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign. / —And there's more where that came from, says he. / —Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I. / —Sweat of my brow, says Joe. ' / Twas the prudent member /  gave me the wheeze. / —I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish. / Who comes through Michan's land,  / bedight /  in sable armour?

The  / Irish Independent / , if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages. / And he starts reading them out: / —Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow... / — / I know that fellow / , says Joe, from bitter experience. / —Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for  / Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber / ? / —Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen. / —I will, says he, honourable person. / —Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form. / Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click. / And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race. / Little Alf Bergan /  popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split. / —Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li... / And he doubled up. / —Take a what? says I. / —Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds. / —O hell! says I. / The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs. / — / Bi i dho husht / , says he. / —Who? says Joe. / —Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man. / —When is long John going to  / hang that fellow in Mountjoy / ? says Joe. / —Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan? / —Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a  / pony / . That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p... / And he started laughing. / —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan? / —Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf. / Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers  / Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun /  brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as  / the sons of deathless Leda / . For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat. / Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as  / to the manner born / , that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals. / But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a  / testoon /  of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the  / rising of the sun to the going down thereof, /  the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop. / —What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside? / —What's that? says Joe. / —Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the  / rhino / . Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here. / So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. / —Are you  / codding / ? says I. / —Honest injun, says Alf. Read them. / So Joe took up the letters. / —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. / So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk: / —How's  / Willy Murray /  those times, Alf? / —I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that... / —You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who? / —With Dignam, says Alf. / —Is it Paddy? says Joe. / —Yes, says Alf. Why? / —Don't you know he's dead? says Joe. / —Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf. / —Ay, says Joe. / —Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff. / —Who's dead? says Bob Doran. / —You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm. / —What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead? / —What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...? / —Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are. / —Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow. / —Paddy? says Alf. / —Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him. / —Good Christ! says Alf. / Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted. / In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the  / etheric double /  being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of  / jivic /  rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in  / a glass darkly /  but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as  / talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat /  and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known. / Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction. / He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail,  / Banba / , with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind. / —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out. / —Who? says I. / —Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes. / And, begob, I saw his  / physog /  do a peep in and then slidder off again. / Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was. / —Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him. / And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence: / —Who said Christ is good? / —I beg your parsnips, says Alf. / —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam? / —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles. / But Bob Doran shouts out of him. / —He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam. / Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there. / —The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character. / The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the  / little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter / , mother kept a  / kip /  in Hardwicke street, that used to be  / stravaging /  about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers,  / fair field and no favour / . / —The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam. / And mournful and with a heavy heart he  / bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven / . / Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door. / —Come in, come on,  / he won't eat you / , says the citizen. / So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there. / —O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you? / And he starts reading out one. / 7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin. / Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged... / —Show us, Joe, says I. / —... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... / —Jesus, says I. / —... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... / The citizen made a grab at the letter. / —Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees. / H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER. / —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen. / —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have? / So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake. / —Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe. / And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it. / —They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses. / And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull. / In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to  / Erebus /  whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord. / So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the  / codology /  of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all  / deterrent effect /  and so forth and so on. / —There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf. / —What's that? says Joe. / —The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf. / —That so? says Joe. / —God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in / Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker. / — / Ruling passion strong in death / , says Joe, as someone said. / —That can be  / explained by science / , says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the... / And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. / The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence /  to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection  / in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis / . / So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about  / the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight /  and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: / —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! / Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of  / the bottom of a Jacobs' tin /  he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel. / And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point,  / the brothers Sheares /  and  / Wolfe Tone /  beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon  / with a back on her like a ballalley / . Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked  / loodheramaun /  of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing  / bézique /  to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.  / And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. /  And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon! / —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom. / —Ay, ay, says Joe. / —You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is... / —Sinn Fein! says the citizen.  / Sinn Fein amhain! /  The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us. / The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by  / Speranza's plaintive muse / . Special quick excursion trains and upholstered  / charabancs /  had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang  / The Night before Larry was stretched /  in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of  / Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone /  (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul  / Petitépatant / , the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von  / Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler / , Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count  / Athanatos Karamelopulos / , Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum  / Effendi / , Senor Hidalgo  / Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora /  de la Malaria, Hokopoko  / Harakiri / , Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen,  / Mynheer Trik van Trumps / , Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli- / Steuer / li, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor  / Kriegfried /   / Ueberallgemein / . All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the  / F. O. T. E. I. /  as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the  / seventeenth of the month /  as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme. / Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the  / Gladiolus Cruentus / . He announced his presence by that gentle  / Rumbold / ian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries,  / hoch, banzai, eljen / ,  / zivio / ,  / chinchin / ,  / polla kronia / , hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing  / evviva /  of the delegate of the  / land of song /  (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since  / the revolution of Rienzi / , being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his  / cassock /  above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The  / nec and non plus ultra /  of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly  / Sheila, my own / . Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a  / hurling match /  in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged  / prebendary /  himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of  / sepoy / s from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: / — / God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way. / So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the  / shoneens /  that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.  / Antitreating /  is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about  / she could get up on a truss of hay /  she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob,  / flahoolagh /  entertainment, don't be talking.  / Ireland sober is Ireland free / . And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two  / sky pilots /  having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt. / So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him. / —Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering. / —No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost. / So he calls the old dog over. / —What's on you, Garry? says he. / Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the  / drouth /  is in it and the  / hydrophobia /  dropping out of his jaws. / All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of  / cynanthropy /  given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the  / ranns /  of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the  / Little Sweet Branch /  has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the  / intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn / , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour. / The curse of my curses / Seven days every day / And seven dry Thursdays / On you, Barney Kiernan, / Has no sup of water / To cool my courage, / And my guts red roaring / After Lowry's lights. / So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another. / —I will, says he,  / a chara / , to show there's no ill feeling. / Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe: / —Could you make a hole in another pint? / —Could a swim duck? says I. / —Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he. / —Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean,  / didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy / . / —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what? / —Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the  / wife's admirers / . / —Whose admirers? says Joe. / —The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom. / Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite!  / Royal and privileged Hungarian /  robbery. / So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another. / —Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness. / —No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup. / —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech. / And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was  / near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby / , 14A. Blind to the world  / up in a shebeen /  in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two  / shawls /  and  / a bully /  on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in  / Adam and Eve's /  when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if  / he didn't patch up the pot / , Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him. / So Terry brought the three pints. / —Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen. / — / Slan leat / , says he. / —Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen. / Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks. / —Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe. / —Friend of yours, says Alf. / — / Nannan / ? says Joe. The mimber? / —I won't mention any names, says Alf. / —I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with  / William Field, M. P / ., the cattle traders. / — / Hairy Iopas / , says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own. / So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a  / knacker's yard / . Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a  / grazier / . Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her  / farting strings /  but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,  / he'd have a soft hand under a hen / . / Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. / —Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons. / —Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens. / —Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight. / —That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure? / —Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen?  / The Sluagh na h-Eireann / . / Mr  / Cowe Conacre /   / (Multifarnham. Nat.) / : Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for  / Shillelagh / , may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition? / Mr  / Allfours /  ( / Tamoshant / . Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative. / Mr  / Orelli O'Reilly /  (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park? / Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative. / Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous  / Mitchelstown /  telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!) / Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question. / Mr  / Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.) / : Don't hesitate to shoot. / (Ironical opposition cheers.) / The speaker: Order! Order! / (The house rises. Cheers.) / —There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there.  / The man that got away James Stephens. /  The champion of all Ireland at  / putting the sixteen pound shot / . What was your best throw, citizen? / — / Na bacleis / , says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow. / —Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better. / —Is that really a fact? says Alf. / —Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that? / So off they started about Irish sports and  / shoneen /  games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and  / racy of the soil /  and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my  / antimacassar /  if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. / A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of  / Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag / , under the auspices of  / Sluagh na h-Eireann / , on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal  / Thomas Osborne Davis / ' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated. / Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc. / —Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match? / —No, says Joe. / —I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf. / —Who? Blazes? says Joe. / And says Bloom: / —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye. / —Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he  / swatting /  all the time. / —We know him, says the citizen.  / The traitor's son / . We know what put English gold in his pocket. / —-True for you, says Joe. / And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: / —Now, don't you think, Bergan? / —Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last  / puck /  in the wind,  / Queensberry rules /  and all, made him puke what he never ate. / It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had  / tapped some lively claret /  in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the  / Portobello /  bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the  / Santry /  boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight. / —He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north. / —He is, says Joe. Isn't he? / —Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday. / — / Mrs B. is the bright particular star / , isn't she? says Joe. / —My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too. / He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent. / Hoho begob says I to myself says I.  / That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest / . Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour.  / Dirty Dan the dodger / 's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you  / Caddareesh / . / Pride of Calpe's rocky mount / , the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the  / garths /  of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms. / And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert. / —Hello, Ned. / —Hello, Alf. / —Hello, Jack. / —Hello, Joe. / —God save you, says the citizen. / —Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned? / —Half one, says Ned. / So J. J. ordered the drinks. / —Were you round at the court? says Joe. / —Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he. / —Hope so, says Ned. / Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in  / Stubbs's / . Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking. / —Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up. / —Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective. / —Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first. / —Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury. / —Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson. / —Me? says Alf. Don't cast your  / nasturtiums /  on my character. / —Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you. / —Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not  / compos mentis / . U. p: up. / —Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn. / —Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law. / —Ha ha, Alf, says Joe. / —Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife. / —Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half. / —How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he... / —Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh. / —Nor good red herring, says Joe. / —That what's I mean, says the citizen. A  / pishogue / , if you know what that is. / Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose  / cockahoop /  after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was  / pewopener /  to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his  / Smashall Sweeney's /  moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody,  / two pair back and passages / , at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world. / —And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie. / Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself. / —Well, good health, Jack, says Ned. / —Good health, Ned, says J. J. / —-There he is again, says Joe. / —Where? says Alf. / And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin. / —How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe. / —Remanded, says J. J. / One of the  / bottlenosed /  fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid. / —Who tried the case? says Joe. / —Recorder, says Ned. / —Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes. / —Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench. / —Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little  / Gumley /  that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge. / And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: / —A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say? / —Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid. / —And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case. / And whereas on the sixteenth day of the  / month of the oxeyed goddess /  and  / in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity / , the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his  / rede /  and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the  / brehons /  at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high  / sinhedrim /  of the  / twelve tribes /  of  / Iar / , for every tribe one man, of  / the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian / , there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on  / rood /  that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him  / ne bail ne mainprise /  but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor. / —Those are nice things, says the citizen,  / coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs. / So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all. / —Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret. / —Rely on me, says Joe. / —Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house. / —O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see. / —Consider that done, says Joe. / —Very kind of you, says Bloom. / —The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in.  / The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here / . / — / Decree nisi / , says J. J. / And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when. / —A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes. / —And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint. / —Give us a squint at her, says I. / And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor. / —O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is! / —There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what? / So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast. / —Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language? / O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the  / tholsel / , and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael. / —It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal  / Sassenachs /  and  / their patois / . / So J. J. puts in a word,  / doing the toff /  about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation. / —Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts. / —The European family, says J. J.... / —They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a  / cabinet d'aisance / . / And says John Wyse: / — / Full many a flower is born to blush unseen / . / And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: / — / Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! / He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the  / medher /  of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan  / Lamh Dearg Abu / , he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes,  / rulers of the waves / , who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods. / —What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had  / lost a bob and found a tanner / . / —Gold cup, says he. / —Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry. / —Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere. / —And Bass's mare? says Terry. / —Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend. / —I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's. / —Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.  / Frailty, thy name is Sceptre / . / So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up.  / Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard. / —Not there, my child, says he. / —Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog. / And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word. / —Some people, says Bloom, can see the  / mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own. / — / Raimeis / , says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules,  / the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind / , with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at  / the fair of Carmen / ? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption? / —As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or  / Heligoland /  with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's... / —Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O. / —Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan. / The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by  / bretelles /  and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor  / Enrique Flor /   / presided at the organ with his wellknown ability /  and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of  / Woodman, spare that tree /  at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest. / —And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway. / —And will again, says Joe. / —And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore,  / none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius / . / And he took the last swig out of the pint.  / Moya / . All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the  / Molly Maguires /  looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant. / —Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have? / —An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion. / —Half one, Terry, says John Wyse,  / and a hands up / . Terry! Are you asleep? / —Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir. / Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one:  / Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga / . A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job. / —But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay? / —I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about  / flogging /  on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One. / So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun. / —A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir  / John Beresford /  called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech. / And says John Wyse: / —'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance. / Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells  / meila murder / . / —That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth. / The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only  / hereditary chamber /  on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs. / —On which the sun never rises, says Joe. / —And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it. / They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid. / —But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force? / Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living. / —We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the  / black 47 / . Their mudcabins and their  / shielings /  by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the  / Grand Turk sent us his piastres / . But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the  / land of the free remember the land of bondage / . And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of  / Granuaile / , the champions of  / Kathleen ni Houlihan / . / —Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was... / —We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala. / —Ay, says John Wyse.  / We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. /  Remember  / Limerick and the broken treatystone / . We gave our best blood to France and Spain,  / the wild geese / .  / Fontenoy / , eh? And  / Sarsfield /  and  / O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain / , and  / Ulysses Browne of Camus /  that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it? / —The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an  / Entente cordiale /  now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were. / —Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer. / —And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from  / George the elector /  down to the  / German lad and the flatulent old bitch /  that's dead? / Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her  / jorum /  of  / mountain dew /  and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about  / Ehren on the Rhine /  and come where the boose is cheaper. / —Well, says J. J. We have  / Edward /  the peacemaker now. / —Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than  / pax /  about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin! / —And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the  / priests and bishops of Ireland /  doing up his room in  / Maynooth /  in  / His Satanic Majesty' / s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less. / —They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf. / And says J. J.: / —Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision. / —Will you try another, citizen? says Joe. / —Yes, sir, says he. I will. / —You? says Joe. / —Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less. / —Repeat that dose, says Joe. / Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about. / —Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations. / —But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse. / —Yes, says Bloom. / —What is it? says John Wyse. / —A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place. / —By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years. / So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: / —Or also living in different places. / —That covers my case, says Joe. / —What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen. / —Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland. / The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. / —After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry. / —Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words. / The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to  / each of the four masters /  his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from  / Carrantuohill / . The scenes depicted on the  / emunctory /  field, showing our ancient  / duns /  and  / raths /  and  / cromlechs /  and  / grianauns /  and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the  / Barmecides / .  / Glendalough / , the lovely lakes of Killarney, the  / ruins of Clonmacnois / , Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle,  / the Scotch house / , Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time. / —Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which? / —That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman. / —And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant. / Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar. / —Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle. / —Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen. / —I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom. / —Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men. / That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag. / —But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life. / —What? says Alf. / —Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment. / Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning. / —A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love. / —Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour. / —That chap? says the citizen.  / Beggar /  my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet. / Love loves to love love. /  Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.  / The man in the brown macintosh /  loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody. / —Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen. / —Hurrah, there, says Joe. / —The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen. / And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle. / —We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about  / sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? /  The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England? / —What's that? says Joe. / So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: / —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias  / Praisegod Barebones / , tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot  / usquebaugh /  to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands. / —Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would. / —Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly. / —Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse. / —No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P. / —And a very good initial too, says Joe. / —That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag. / —Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that  / report /  by a man what's this his name is? / — / Casement / , says the citizen. He's an Irishman. / —Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them. / —I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers. / —Who? says I. / —Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels. / —Is it that whiteeyed  / kaffir / ? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life? / —That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a  / hundred shillings to five on / . He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse. / —He's a bloody  / dark horse /  himself, says Joe. / — / Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out. / —There you are, says Terry. / Goodbye Ireland I'm going to  / Gort / . So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos. / So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying  / it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith /  to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his  / argol bargol / . And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one. / —Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham. / Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense. / Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their  / palfreys / . / —Ho,  / varlet / ! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us! / So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. / Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his  / tabard / . / —Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow. / —Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it. / —Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships. / —How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun? / An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage. / —Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me. / —Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty  / trencherman /  by his aspect. Hast aught to give us? / Mine host bowed again as he made answer: / —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish? / —Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios! / —Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue. / So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom. / —Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans. / —Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein? / —That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege. / —Who made those allegations? says Alf. / —I, says Joe. I'm the  / alligator / . / —And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow? / —Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is. / —Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton. / —Who is  / Junius / ? says J. J. / —We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian. / —He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle. / —Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power. / —Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was  / Virag / , the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by  / deedpoll / , the father did. / —That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages! / —Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we. / —Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother. / —Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan. / —O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of  / Neave's food /  six weeks before the wife was delivered. / — / En ventre sa mère / , says J. J. / —Do you call that a man? says the citizen. / —I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe. / —Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power. / —And who does he suspect? says the citizen. / Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye. / —Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait. / — / A wolf in sheep's clothing / , says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary!  / Ahasuerus /  I call him. Cursed by God. / —Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned. / —Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S. / —You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry. / —Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores. / —Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer. / —Amen, says the citizen. / —And I'm sure He will, says Joe. / And at the sound of the  / sacring bell / , headed by a crucifer with acolytes,  / thurifers / , boatbearers, readers,  / ostiarii / , deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles,  / aspergills / , unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the  / introit in Epiphania Domini /  which beginneth  / Surge, illuminare /  and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers. / —Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini. / —Qui fecit coelum et terram. / —Dominus vobiscum. / —Et cum spiritu tuo. / And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: / —Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum. / —And so say all of us, says Jack. / —Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford. / —Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish. / I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry. / —I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not... / —No, says Martin, we're ready. / Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five. / —Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, / —Beg your pardon, says he. / —Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now. / —Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret. / And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl. / —Bye bye all, says Martin. / And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car. / —-Off with you, says / Martin to the jarvey. / The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves. / But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the  / dropsy / , and he cursing the  / curse of Cromwell /  on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him. / —Let me alone, says he. / And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: / —Three cheers for Israel! / Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would. / And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing  / If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew /  and a slut shouts out of her: / —Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! / And says he: / —Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and  / Mercadante /  and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God. / — / He had no father / , says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead. / —Whose God? says the citizen. / —Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me. / Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop. / —By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for  / using the holy name. / By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here. / —Stop! Stop! says Joe. / A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob  / agus /  Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of  / Come back to Erin / , followed immediately by  / Rakoczsy's March / . Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that  / rent the welkin / , responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant  / Cambrian and Caledonian hills / , the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.  / Visszontlátásra, kedves baráton! Visszontlátásra! /  Gone but not forgotten. / Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre: / —Where is he till I murder him? / And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing. / —Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel. / But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him. / —Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop! / Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street. / The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of  / Mercalli's scale / , and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of  / 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas / . The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special  / missa pro defunctis /  shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of débris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I. / You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him. / —Did I kill him, says he, or what? / And he shouting to the bloody dog: / —After him, Garry! After him, boy! / And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you. / When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry:  / Abba! Adonai! /  And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'February 2, 1922', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Modernism (Literature)', 'Literature']}"

Except, it didn't start with him, and it wasn't a book, but a tome. Here is a brief history: / It starts in the 1960's with a spoken word artist known as Gil Scott-Heron. He revolutionised the spoken word genre by having the words be more melodic. Little would he know, he was the first ever rapper and the earliest writer of the Rapper's Tome, which would jump from rapper to rapper time after time.. / At that time, a group of rappers came together and formed The Sugarhill Gang. They would be known in the late 70's and early 80's but would soon flame out into obscurity. The rap world was infertile for a majority of the decade.. / That was until 1989 and the Golden Age of Rap. One fateful day, an up-and-coming rapper called Biz Markie notched one of the most successful rap songs in history, ""Just a Friend."" The apparition of Gil Scott-Heron came to him in a dream and told him he would be the first man after Big Bank Hank of The Sugarhill Gang He was the first Great Prophet of the tome / When Biz Markie became irrelevant, Sir Mixalot's ""Baby Got Back"" came along and became influential in both hip-hop (Lil' Wayne) and R&B (Trey Songz). It was intended as a body empowerment song, but ended up as the pinnacle of objectification. His reign as Great Prophet was short, but it left a mark on the industry.. / The mid-1990's brought in a new set of prophets: The N.W.A. Lead by Dr. Dre, as well as fellow prophets Ice Cube and Eazy-E, the N.W.A. left its mark on the industry as one of the greatest rap groups in history. Tragedy struck, however. Because of the AIDS disease, Eazy-E's life was claimed, ending the N.W.A.'s grip on the tome.. / Enter Tupac. He would be the most efficient of the prophets, releasing a few per year and being acclaimed all the way through. He got help from his friend at the time, Biggie Smalls. It wasn't to last, as Biggie and Tupac were going further and further away from each other to the point of becoming purely foes. They were both shot in the span of seven months from 1996-97.. / In the meantime, Dr Dre made his own rap label, Aftermath Records, and one fateful day brought a young man who was not only broke and homeless, but also humiliated at the Rap Olympics and contemplating suicide. It was Marshall Mathers, who would soon be recognised as Eminem. He impressed Dre and his fellow friends and rappers, considering Eminem was white, or a ""honky,"" as some people in the studio said. He released his first two albums (Infinite and The Slim Shady LP) and they were moderately successful, but he wouldn't reach Great Prophet status until 2000 and The Marshall Mathers LP. From there, he kept making great rap songs from that point until the disastrous Encore album in 2004. His title was to go elsewhere.. / Ludacris would be the next Prophet. This was mainly due to his unlimited charisma and skilled writing. He would encounter a bad song like Money Maker sometimes, but he was generally considered to be pure perfection. He consensually gave up his title in 2010, leaving it to who was the biggest rapper at the time.. / Unfortunately, that rapper was Lil' Wayne, who took his cadences from Sir Mixalot's run as Prophet. A dark age of rap happened. Four years of bad rap music dominated the charts and whilst there were some good rappers, like Kanye, Jay-Z, Macklemore, and Eminem (Who got back on track.), the world was taken over by awful acts. By the time 2014 came around, the rap scene recovered slightly / Enter the current and first female Prophet: Iggy Azalea. She dominated the last year and a half, working with people like Charli XCX, M0, and Britney Spears. Whilst she herself was only okay, Vine leeched the rap charts, and DJ mustard rose to prominence, the rap scene improved greatly with the rise of artists like Kendrick Lamar and Lupe Fiasco. It is a good period at the moment, but Lamar is eying the position, and is destined to be the next of the Prophets.. / That was the entire history of the Rapper's Tome. It is surprisingly old, but still as functional as ever. Special thanks to Clairie Mcberrie for the inspiration.﻿","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'July 5, 2015', 'Tags': ['Rap']}"

I’m 52-years-old, I have been in bands continuously, and active in the music scene in one way or another since about 1978. At the moment I’m in a band, I also work as a recording engineer and I own a recording studio in Chicago. In the past I have also been a fanzine writer, radio club DJ, concert promoter and I ran a small record label. I was not terribly successful at any of those things, but I have done them, so they qualify as part of my CV. / I work every day with music and with bands and I have for more than 30 years. I’ve made a couple thousand records for independent bands and rock stars, for big labels and small ones. I made a record two days ago and I’ll be making one on Monday when I get off the plane. So I believe this puts me in a pretty good position to evaluate the state of the music scene today, as it relates to how it used to be and how it has been. / We’re all here to talk about the state of the music scene and the health of the music community. I’ll start by saying that I’m both satisfied and optimistic about the state of the music scene. And I welcome the social and technological changes that have influenced it. I hope my remarks today will start a conversation and through that conversation we can invoke an appreciation of how resilient the music community is, how supportive it can be and how welcoming it should be. / I hear from some of my colleagues that these are rough times: that the internet has cut the legs off the music scene and that pretty soon nobody will be making music anymore because there’s no money in it. Virtually every place where music is written about, there is some version of this troubling perspective. People who used to make a nice income from royalties, they’ve seen the royalties dry up. And people who used to make a living selling records are having trouble selling downloads as substitute for records, and they no longer make records. / So there is a tacit assumption that this money, lost money, needs to be replaced and a lot of energy has been spent arguing from where that money will come. Bitchiness about this abounds, with everybody insisting that somebody else should be paying him, but that he shouldn’t have to pay for anybody else. I would like to see an end to this dissatisfaction. / It’s worthwhile to remember from where we’ve come. From where this bitchiness originates. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the period in which I was most active in bands in the music scene – let’s call this the pre-internet era. The music industry was essentially the record industry, in that records and radio were the venues through which people learned of music and principally experienced it. They were joined by MTV and videos in the 80s and 90s, but the principle relationship people had with music was as sound recordings. There was a booming band scene and all bands aspired to getting recorded, as a mark of legitimacy. / But recording was a rare and expensive enterprise, so it wasn’t common. Even your demo tape required considerable investment. So when I started playing in bands in the 70s and 80s most bands went through their entire lifecycle without so much as a note of their music ever being recorded. / Now I’m going to describe the scene as I observed it in America, but I understand that most of the structures and conditions I observed have parallels in other markets. Maybe somebody from my generation can add the local Aussie colour to my comments – I prefer them shouted in as thick an accent as you can muster. / As a yardstick for the economics of the day or for the era, in 1979 you could buy a 45rpm single for a buck, a new album for $5, go see a club gig for $1 or a stadium gig for $7. I know these things because I still have some old ticket stubs and price stickers on my records. Note the relative parity between the live show costs and the recorded music costs. A gradual inflation of prices remained under way through the 90s, making recorded music more expensive, though it remained the principal means of experience. / The whole industry depended on these sales, and sales depended on exposure. Bands on big labels toured, essentially to promote their recordings. And the labels provided promotional and logistical support to keep the bands on the road. This supported a network of agents and managers and roadies and promotional staff, so the expense was considerable. / Retail outlets also offered special placements and promotion: displays, posters, mentions in print ads, giveaways, trinkets and what were called end cap displays. Record labels paid handsomely for these promotions and the stores used the sale of these promotions as additional income. Chain stores especially relied on corporate chain-wide promotions, regardless what the stores might think their local clientele might like. It wasn’t uncommon to see big displays of hair metal bands in urban outlets where they couldn’t sell a single stick but the labels had paid for their utility, so up they went. / Radio stations were enormously influential. Radio was the only place to hear music from any people and record companies paid dearly to influence them. Direct payola had been made illegal but this was a trivial workaround. Record pluggers acting as programming consultants were the middlemen. They paid radio stations for access to their programmers and conducted meetings where new records were promoted. / These promotional offers were quite lucrative. But their metrics depended on radio stations recording that they had added the records to their playlist. To satisfy this requirement and keep the promotional money flowing, radio stations often played tiny fragments of songs jumbled one after the other in any incomprehensible flow during late-night programming hours, to satisfy the programming requirement that they add songs to their playlist. Popular radio stations also staged mammoth concerts, often for free or for nominal cover featuring bands that the labels were promoting. These unpaid radio gigs were a drag on their touring income but the promotional value was presumed to be worth it.Journalists and editors who could place reviews, program directors and independent DJs who could add records to playlists or played in nightclubs, were subject to much buttering up. Promotional trinkets and advance copies of records were sent their way. Sometimes by the box. Presumably these were listening and file copies. But they were actually a bribe. These promotional copies were immediately sold secondhand to record stores and it was not uncommon for such stores to be overstocked with a new release prior to its official release as a result. My wife worked in a record store that bought records secondhand in the 90s. And their biggest repeat customers, by a long shot, were the people on these label promo lists. The staff at her store kept a tally for awhile and the editor of the local weeklies music section made a comfortable second income amounting to a $1,000 or more a month from selling these promo copies. / So it was a leaky system, riddled with inefficiencies, but a lot of people made a living through it. Record store owners, buyers, employees, ad agencies, designers, club owners, label reps, A&R, producers, recording studios, publicists, lawyers, journalists, program directors, distributors, tour managers, booking agents, band managers, and all the ancillary services they required: banking, shipping, printing, photography, travel agencies, limos, spandex wardrobe, cocaine dealers, prostitutes. Because of this great bulk of the industry needed to sustain itself. Every facet of the industry was tailored to this need. / The most significant bit of tailoring was an accounting trick called recouping costs. The costs of making a record wasn’t borne by the record label, except initially. Those costs were recouped or taken out of the income the band might otherwise run as royalties. The same was true of all those promo copies, posters, radio pluggers and payola men, producers, publicists, tour support, 8x10 glossies, shipping, freight – basically anything that could be associated with a specific band or record was ultimately paid for by the band, not by the record label. / As the label shifted from vinyl to CD as the dominant format, the labels could easily sell the CD as a convenient, compact, trouble-free way to listen to music. The profit margin exploded and the money got stupid. Retails costs of a CD was half again or double more than an LP but the manufacturing, shipping and storage costs were a tiny fraction. The labels even used vinyl’s legacy as a tool to increase this profit margin by charging bands for unique packaging, despite the fact that CD packaging was designed to be standardised. Or pre-emptively charging back for broken CDs at a rate implying that someone was attacking the inventory with an axe. / In the end the bands operating under this system earned very little from their record sales, unless they were monumental stars. Often enough bands would conduct their entire careers with a label and never reach the point where they had sufficiently recouped to get paid anything at all. Now the label made its per-piece profit on every record sold. And could recoup the cost of any records unsold. And all those other people got paid using the money that would have otherwise gone to the bands as royalties. Unsurprisingly, those other people also got paid pretty well. It stands to reason that if the label is paying you with someone else’s money, the label doesn’t need to care how much you charge. / During the 90s there was something of an arms race to see who could write the biggest deal. That is, the deal with the most money being spent on the band’s behalf. In a singularly painless contest the money would either be paid to the band as a royalty, which would take that money out of the system and put it into things like houses and groceries and college educations. Or it could be paid to other operators within the industry, increasing the clout and prestige of the person doing the spending. It’s as if your boss, instead of giving your paycheck to you, could pay that money to his friends and business associates, invoking your name as he did. Since his net cost was the same and his friends and associates could return the favour, why would he ever want to let any of that money end up in your hands? It was a system that ensured waste by rewarding the most profligate spendthrifts in a system specifically engineered to waste the band’s money. / Now bands existed outside that label spectrum. The working bands of the type I’ve always been in, and for those bands everything was always smaller and simpler. Promotion was usually down to flyers posted on poles, occasional mentions on college radio and fanzines. If you had booked a gig at a venue that didn’t advertise, then you faced a very real prospect of playing to an empty room. Local media didn’t take bands seriously until there was a national headline about them so you could basically forget about press coverage. And commercial radio was absolutely locked up by the payola-driven system of the pluggers and program directors. / International exposure was extraordinarily expensive. In order for your records to make it into overseas hands you had to convince a distributor to export them. And that was difficult with no means for anyone to hear the record and decide to buy it. So you ended up shipping promotional copies overseas at a terrific expense, never sure if they would be listened to or not. / The one exception to this was the brilliant BBC DJ John Peel. He listened religiously to every single record he received in the mail, devoting hours of every day to the task. I sent him a copy of the first album I ever made and not only did he play the record on air, he sent me back a postcard with a personal remembrance of Chicago, of visiting a matron aunt as a child in Evanston, the suburb where my post office box was kept. I treasured that note as the first indication that John Peel was a great man. / So these independent bands had to be resourceful. They’d built their own infrastructure of independent clubs, promoters, fanzines and DJs. They had their own channels of promotion, including the beginnings of the internet culture that is so prevalent today – that being bulletin boards, and newsgroups. These independent bands even made their own record label. Some were collectives and those that weren’t were likely to operate on a profit-sharing basis that encouraged efficiency, rather than a recoupable patronage system that encouraged indulgence. / That’s where I cut my teeth, in that independent scene full of punks and noise freaks and drag queens and experimental composers and jabbering street poets. You can thank punk rock for all of that. That’s where most of us learned that it was possible to make your own records, to conduct your own business and keep control of your own career. If a bunch of pimply glue sniffers could do it, we reasoned, then anybody could. / The number of records released this way was incredible. Thousands of small releases made their way into the “mom and pop” independent speciality stores, which then provided a market for independent distribution. It was the beginnings of an alternative to the label paradigm. It was cumbersome and slow but it was more efficient than a shotgun approach with the big labels, whose answer to every problem was to spend more of the band’s money on it. / It was the beginning of what we would call the peer network. By mid-90s there were independent labels and distributors moving millions of dollars of records and CDs. And there was a healthy underground economy of bands making a reasonable income owing to the superior efficiencies of the independent methods. My band, as an example, was returned 50% of the net profit on every title that we released through our record label. I worked it out and that earned us a better per-piece royalty than Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Prince, Madonna or any other superstar operating concurrently. And we were only one of thousands of such bands.So, that was the system as it was. That’s what we lost when the internet made everything available everywhere for free. And make no mistake about it, we have lost it. There is still an independent label network but it’s a slim fraction of what it was. The labels continuing to survive do so by supplying niche music to a discerning audience. And because they have been steeled in the art of efficiency their constitution allows them to scale everything to suit the remaining demand. / You may have noticed that in my description of the mass market music scene and the industry as it was pre-internet I made little mention of the audience or the bands. Those two ends of the spectrum were hardly considered by the rest of the business. Fans were expected to listen to the radio and buy records and bands were expected to make records and tour to promote them. And that was about all the thought either were given. But the audience was where all the money came from and the bands were where all the music came from. / Through the internet, which more than anything else creates access to things, limitless music eventually became available for free. The big record companies didn’t see how to make money from online distribution so they effectively ignored it, leaving it to the hackers and the audience to populate a new landscape of downloading. People who prefer the convenience of CDs over LPs naturally prefer downloaded music even more. You could download it or stream it or listen from YouTube or have your friends on message boards or acquaintances send you zip files. In the blink of an eye music went from being rare, expensive and only available through physical media in controlled outlets to being ubiquitous and free worldwide. What a fantastic development. / There’s a lot of shade thrown by people in the music industry about how terrible the free sharing of music is, how it’s the equivalent of theft, etc. That’s all bullshit and we’ll deal with that in a minute. But for a minute I want you to look at the experience of music from a fan’s perspective, post-internet. Music that is hard to find was now easy to find. Music to suit my specific tastes, as fucked up as they might be, was now accessible by a few clicks or maybe posting a query on a message board. In response I had more access to music than I had ever imagined. Curated by other enthusiasts, keen to turn me on to the good stuff; people, like me, who want other people to hear the best music ever. / This audience-driven music distribution has other benefits. Long-forgotten music has been given a second life. And bands whose music that was ahead of its time has been allowed to reach a niche audience that the old mass distribution failed to find for them, as one enthusiast turns on the next and this forgotten music finally gets it due. There’s a terrific documentary about one such case, the Detroit band Death whose sole album was released in a perfunctory edition in, I believe, 1975 and disappeared until a copy of it was digitised and made public on the internet. Gradually the band found an audience, their music got lovingly reissued, and the band has resurrected, complete with tours playing to packed houses. And the band are now being allowed the career that the old star system had denied them. There are hundreds of such stories and there are speciality labels that do nothing but reissue lost classics like that once they surface. / Now look at the conditions from a band’s perspective, the conditions faced by a band. In contrast to back in the day, recording equipment and technology has simplified and become readily available. Computers now come pre-loaded with enough software to make a decent demo recording and guitar stores sell microphones and other equipment inexpensively that previously was only available at a premium from arcane speciality sources. Essentially every band now has the opportunity to make recordings. / And they can do things with those recordings. They can post them online in any number of places: Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud, their own websites. They can link to them on message boards, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and even in the comment streams of other music. “LOL,” “this sucks,” “much better,” “death to false metal,” “LOL”. Instead of spending a fortune on international phone calls trying to find someone in each territory to listen to your music, every band on the planet now has free, instant access to the world at its fingertips. / I cannot overstate how important a development that is. Previously, in the top-down paradigm allowed local industry to dictate what music was available in isolated or remote markets, markets isolated by location or language. It was inconceivable that a smaller or independent band could have market penetration into, say, Greece or Turkey, Japan or China, South America, Africa or the Balkans. Who would you ask to handle your music? How would you find him? And how would you justify the business and currency complications required to send four or five copies of a record there? / Now those places are as well-served as New York and London. Fans can find the music they like and develop direct relationships with the bands. It is absolutely possible – I’m sure it happens every day – that a kid in one of these far-flung places can find a new favourite band, send that band a message, and that singer of that band will read it and personally reply to it from his cell phone half a world away. How much better is that? I’ll tell you, it’s infinitely better than having a relationship to a band limited to reading it on the back of the record jacket. If such a thing were possible when I was a teenager I’m certain I would have become a right nuisance to the Ramones. / A couple of years ago my band mounted a tour of eastern Europe. We played all the hot spots: the Czech Republic, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, we made it as far as Istanbul, Turkey. It was a magical experience, playing in front of audiences who were relatively unjaded by the routine of touring bands and we were welcomed like friends. We played to full houses at the same size venues as the rest of Europe. The same sizes as we would play here in Australia. And the audiences seem equivocally familiar with our music. The key difference being that most of the places have literally never sold a single record. Essentially 100% of our exposure had been through informal means over the internet or hand-to-hand. / On that trip we established contacts with local promoters and arts organisations and audiences developed an appetite for our music and we have since sold quite a few records into the region. Our next tour through the region was easier as a result and we’re going back to Istanbul this spring, using contacts made on that first exploratory trip. I expect to have a marvellous time. / In short, the internet has made it much easier to conduct the day-to-day business of being in a band and has increased the efficiency. Everything from scheduling rehearsals using online calendars, to booking tours by email, to selling merchandise and records from online stores, down to raising the funds to make a record is a new simplicity that bands of the pre-internet era would salivate over. The old system was built by the industry to serve the players inside the industry. The new system where music is shared informally and the bands have a direct relationship to the fans was built by the bands and the fans in the manner of the old underground. It skips all the intermediary steps. / Bands now have default control of their exposure. It’s no longer necessary to pay people to pay other people to play your records on the radio, only to have those people lie about doing so. It’s no longer necessary to spend money to let people hear your band. It happens automatically.There’s another, much subtler change that all this instigated. Since people no longer have to make do listening to whatever is on the radio playlist and are no longer limited to owning what the store decides to stock, they have become much more indulgent in their tastes. My friends now normally listen to exotic playlists that they have dreamed up themselves, full of counterintuitive and contrasting choices that are uniquely theirs. / Our office bearer has a hi-fi in that studio office and is as likely to be playing the new 45 from the hardcore band Leather or electro drone by Tim Hecker as he is to be playing a deep cut of Cincinnati soul or handbag disco or improv guitar noodlings, whether newly released from Oren Ambarchi or 30 years old from the Takoma label. People can now listen only to music they are ecstatic about, all the time. / There are active online communities for every kind of music and its subcultures. Whether you’re into Dusty’s Deep Cut reggae, minimal electronics, symphonic pop, Texas blues, Japanese noise, power electronics, children’s music, christmas music, Raymond Scott, or Burl Ives, I guarantee there is an online community where you can connect with other enthusiasts to indulge the minute specificity of your tastes. / These online communities are now a vital part of the scene and this debate and others are hashed out there daily. I’ve probably unconsciously lifted some of my positions in these remarks from discussions I’ve had online so I’d like to confess that plagiarism now, as a way to encourage all of you to get involved in these forums where all the interesting conversations about music is happening. / Imagine a great hall of fetishes where whatever you felt like fucking or being fucked by, however often your tastes might change, no matter what hardware or harnesses were required, you could open the gates and have at it on a comfy mattress at any time of day. That’s what the internet has become for music fans. Plus bleacher seats for a cheering section. / As a result fans are more ardent for this music. They are willing to spend more on seeing it played live. They are willing to buy more ephemera and eager to establish a personal relationship to the people who make the music. Gig prices have escalated as a result. And the merchandise tables at gigs are universally teeming with activity. Back home, gigs that used to cost five or six bucks are now 20 or 30. Over here the ticket inflation has been more pronounced, with club gigs going for $80 or more. As a result gig income for bands has increased exponentially. My band has been playing a lot of the same places for the entirety of our existence, over 20 years now. I guess you could say we’ve saturated our audience, no matter how long we stay at it. Some of these perennial gigs are now paying an over of magnitude better than they were 10 or 15 years ago. That’s right, some places where we used to earn four or five hundred dollars we now earn four or five grand. / This ease of access, redoubled interest and increase in income has created a new partnership and possibilities between individuals, bands and visual artists, online film-makers, choreographers and other kinds of public people. Collaborations take place in real time or displaced over the internet where the parties often never meet face-to-face. I have a dear friend who found himself with a bunch of time on his hands last year so he formed a couple of new bands. One of these bands was entirely populated by people he only knew online and all of their music was made by online collaboration. This music was a pure result of the interconnectivity of the internet. / All of that, all of those characteristics, all of those possibilities were instigated and made possible by the online sharing of music. If not directly, as in the case of building an audience for the band Death and my own band in the Balkans and beyond, then indirectly by changing the expectations of the listeners and musicians. / This explains my enthusiasm for the way the music scene has changed, but what about my optimism? I would like to address a platitude about the online exposure of music. From all quarters we hear that, this is the platitude: “We need to figure out how to make internet distribution work for everyone.” I use finger quotes to indicate intellectual distance between myself and the quotation. I have a friend, Tim Midgett, who uses three fingers for finger quotes to indicate extra irony. This is a two jobber. / I disagree with this rather inoffensive platitude. It’s innocuous and vapid and fills the air after someone asks the question, “How is the music scene these days?” And it maintains hope that the current state of affairs as mentioned, presumed to be tragic, can be changed for the better. For “everyone”. That word everyone is important to the people using the sentence. In their mind the physical distribution model worked for everyone. But the new one does not. Not yet, not yet. Not until we “figure it out”. I’m sure we’re all going to get tired of me doing that [air quotes]. / I disagree that the old way is better. And I do not believe this sentence to be true: “We need to figure out how to make this digital distribution work for everyone.” I disagree with it because within its mundane language are tacit assumptions: the framework of an exploitative system that I have been at odds with my whole creative life. Inside that trite sentence, “We need to figure out how to make this work for everyone,” hides the skeleton of a monster. / Let’s start at the beginning. “We need to figure out”: the subject of that sentence, the first-person plural, sounds inclusive but the context defeats that presumption. Who would have the power to implement a new distribution paradigm? Who would be in the room when we discuss our plans for it? Who would do the out figuring we need to do? Industry and consumers? Consumers is a likely response, but did the consumers get a vote about how their music would be compressed or tagged or copy protected or made volatile? Did anybody? Did the consumers get a choice about whether or not Apple stuck a U2 album on their iTunes library? Of course not. These things were just done and we had to deal with them as a state of being. Consumers rebelling or complaining about things – “market pushback” – isn’t the same thing as being involved in the decision to do something. Clearly the “we” of this sentence doesn’t include the listener. I believe any attempt to organise the music scene that ignores the listener is doomed. / How about the bands? Do the bands get a seat at the “we” table, while our figuring-out needs are met? Of course not. If you ask bands what they want – and I know this because I’m in a band and I deal with bands every day – what they want is a chance to expose their music and to have a shot at getting paid by their audience. I believe the current operating status satisfies the first of these conditions exquisitely and the latter at least as well as the old record label paradigm. / So who is this “we”? The administrative parts of the old record business, that’s who. The vertical labels who hold copyright on a lot of music. They want to do the figuring. They want to set the agenda. And they want to do all the structural tinkering. The bands, the audience, the people who make music and who pay for it – they are conspicuously not in the discussion. / How about the word “need”, we “need” to figure out? The need is actually a “want”, a preference. These remnants of the music industry are unsatisfied with how the internet, the bands and the audience can get along fine without them. So they prefer to change things to re-establish relevance. You see this in the spate of 360 deals that are being offered now, where everything a band does, from their music to their T-shirts to their Twitter accounts belong to the record label. In exchange the record label offers startup money. I believe this approach is doomed by things like Kickstarter, which have proven more effective and efficient at raising money directly from the audience that wants to support the music. / How about the infinitive “to figure out”? We need “to figure out”. That presumes that we can know how to attack a global distribution enterprise long after the internet has crowdsourced an efficient and painless way to do precisely that. There’s a reason the water faucet hasn’t changed radically over the years. Time and trial have demonstrated that the best and simplest way to control hot water is by turning a tap. Problem solved, no further solving of the hot water faucet problem is required. I cannot be the only one who is annoyed by the constantly misaligned proximity faucets in public washrooms. Imagine if listening to music was as frustrating as that. / The next part of the sentence: “make” distribution work. This implies that we have control over the distribution, that we can make it do some things but not others. The internet proves this to be a fallacy. Once we release music it’s out of our control. I use the verb “release” because it’s common vernacular. But I think it’s a perfect description. Even more apt if you consider what happens when you release other things, say a bird or a fart. When you release them they’re in the world and the world will react and use them as it sees fit. The fart may wrinkle noses until it dissipates. The bird may fly outside and crap on windshields; it may get shot down by a farmer. It’s been released, so you have no control over it. You can’t recall the fart, however much you would like to. You can’t protect the bird. / Distribution is a problematic word. Its prior meaning implies scarcity and allocation of physical products. You can inventory them, you could tax them, duty them, you could search somebody’s book bag for them. None of that is true with digital files. If it were possible to return digital files to the strict control of the record labels (it is impossible, don’t worry), what would be their incentive to be honest in their accounting? In the physical distribution model you could inventory the titles in the warehouse during an audit and compare them with the delivery manifests from the press manufacturing plant, and know with reasonable accuracy how many copies had been sold. How on earth would you inventory a digital file? Count how many were left on the shelf? / That word is problematic, but the most problematic word in the sentence is the word “work”: we need to figure out how to make it “work”. Work is an impossible word in this context. Depending on who uses it, it will have contradictory meanings. For a label the system would work if it generated a profit per play, controlled access to music while providing access to the audience for advertisers as an additional income, and allowed the availability of push marketing for promotion. For the listener it would mean open access, ability to find specific and niche music, continuous playback, lack of nuisance, ease of use, freedom from spying, low or no cost, utility on different devices, lack of push marketing and lack of advertising. For a band it would mean finding an audience and having no barrier to participation, and no limits on amount of material made available. You can see how this is problematic. It is literally impossible for a system to satisfy all of these needs simultaneously when they are contradictory. / And the hybrid approaches being tried are clumsy and insulting. I recently tried streaming a podcast from an official licensed site. When the cats started fighting I missed a little bit, having to separate the cats and then feed the cats and then calmed them down. I came back to my computer and tried to replay the last few minutes that I had missed but was greeted with a notice that due to copyright agreements this player was not allowed to rewind the podcast. I find it unimaginable that the people who posted the podcast wanted that provision enabled. And the site just ensured that I would never bother with their product again. / The conclusion of that sentence, the “for everyone” is also problematic. I don’t think it is necessary or even preferable to have everyone involved in defining the experience with music or more generally the relationship with the band and its audience. We seem to accept that record stores, who were once the welcoming face of the industry and the recipient of much promotional patronage described earlier, are not coming along in the digital era. Record stores now get their appeal from carrying secondhand records, something the industry used to have a regular shit fit about. And by carrying speciality and niche material that is too marginal for corporate attention, they are clearly not part of the “everyone” in the sentence. / So there’s no reason to insist that other obsolete bureaux and offices of the lapsed era be brought along into the new one. The music industry has shrunk. In shrinking it has rung out the middle, leaving the bands and the audiences to work out their relationship from the ends. I see this as both healthy and exciting. If we’ve learned anything over the past 30 years it’s that left to its own devices bands and their audiences can get along fine: the bands can figure out how to get their music out in front of an audience and the audience will figure out how to reward them. / The internet has facilitated the most direct and efficient, compact relationship ever between band and audience. And I do not mourn the loss of the offices of inefficiencies that died in the process. I suppose some people are out of work. But the same things happened when the automobile replaced the horse, and all the blacksmiths had to adapt, spending their time making garden gates rather than horseshoes. / When I read over these notes on the plane today I felt like I spent too much time enumerating complaints, and I don’t want to conclude without reiterating how terrific the current music environment is. I see more bands and I hear more music than ever before in my life. There are more gigs, more songs available than ever before, bands are being treated with more respect, and are more in control of their careers and destinies. I see them continuing as a constellation of enterprises: some big, some small – most small but all of them with a more immediate response from their audience and a greater chance to succeed. It is genuinely exciting. / I’ve been talking an awful long time, but I have not yet mentioned the intellectual property debate. I’ll try to get that out of the way briefly now. I would like to leave room for questions after I speak, and though I’m leaving out a lot – publishing, stolen credits, sampling, fair use, inspiration – I suspect there will be a healthy discussion afterward and think that such discussions are necessary and overdue. / From my part, I believe the very concept of exclusive intellectual property with respect to recorded music has come to a natural end, or something like an end. Technology has brought to a head a need to embrace the meaning of the word “release”, as in bird or fart. It is no longer possible to maintain control over digitised material and I don’t believe the public good is served by trying to. / There is great public good by letting creative material lapse into the public ownership. The copyright law has been modified so extensively in the past decades that now this essentially never happens, creating absurdities whenever copyright is invoked. There’s a huge body of work that is not legally in the public domain, though its rights holder, authors and creators have died or disappeared as businesses. And this material, from a legal standpoint now removed from our culture – nobody may copy it or re-release it because it’s still subject to copyright. / Other absurdities abound: innocuous usage of music in the background of home videos or student projects is technically an infringement and official obstacles are set up to prevent it. If you want a video of your wedding reception – your father’s first dance with a new bride – it’s off limits unless it is silent. If your little daughter does a kooky dance to a Prince song don’t bother putting it on YouTube for her grandparents to see or a purple dwarf in assless chaps will put an injunction on you. Did I offend the little guy? Fuck him. His music is poison and he hits women. / Music has entered the environment as an atmospheric element, like the wind, and in that capacity should not be subject to control and compensation. Well, not unless the rights holders are willing to let me turn the tables on it. If you think my listening is worth something, OK then, so do I. Play a Phil Collins song while I’m grocery shopping? Pay me $20. Def Leppard? Make it $100. Miley Cyrus? They don’t print money big enough.","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'November 15, 2014', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Speeches', 'Industrial', 'Post-Punk', 'Post-Rock', 'Post-Hardcore', 'Hardcore Punk', 'Noise Rock', 'Noise', 'Independent', 'Indie Rock', 'Punk Rock', 'News']}"

He had lost his assertive self-confidence. He no longer pronounced emphatically and ultimately on every subject, nor did he seek to dominate, as he had always done, the company in which he found himself. I was surprised to see him so courteous and attentive to George. He moved unobtrusively about the room while Lettie was chattering, and in his demeanour there was a new reserve, a gentleness and grace. It was charming to see him offering the cigarettes to George, or, with beautiful tact, asking with his eyes only whether he should refill the glass of his guest, and afterward replacing it softly close to the other's hand. / To Lettie he was unfailingly attentive, courteous, and undemonstrative. / Towards the end of my holiday he had to go to London on business, and we agreed to take the journey together. We must leave Woodside soon after eight o'clock in the morning. Lettie and he had separate rooms. I thought she would not have risen to take breakfast with us, but at a quarter-past seven, just as Rebecca was bringing in the coffee, she came downstairs. She wore a blue morning gown, and her hair was as beautifully dressed as usual. / ""Why, my darling, you shouldn't have troubled to come down so early,"" said Leslie, as he kissed her. / ""Of course, I should come down,"" she replied, lifting back the heavy curtains and looking out on the snow where the darkness was wilting into daylight. ""I should not let you go away into the cold without having seen you take a good breakfast. I think it is thawing. The snow on the rhododendrons looks sodden and drooping. Ah, well, we can keep out the dismal of the morning for another hour."" She glanced at the clock—""just an hour!"" she added. He turned to her with a swift tenderness. She smiled to him, and sat down at the coffee-maker. We took our places at table. / ""I think I shall come back to-night,"" he said quietly, almost appealingly. / She watched the flow of the coffee before she answered. Then the brass urn swung back, and she lifted her face to hand him the cup. / ""You will not do anything so foolish, Leslie,"" she said calmly. / He took his cup, thanking her, and bent his face over the fragrant steam. / ""I can easily catch the 7:15 from St. Pancras,"" he replied, without looking up. / ""Have I sweetened to your liking Cyril?"" she asked, and then, as she stirred her coffee she added, ""It is ridiculous Leslie! You catch the 7.15 and very probably miss the connection at Nottingham. You can't have the motor-car there, because of the roads. Besides, it is absurd to come toiling home in the cold slushy night when you may just as well stay in London and be comfortable."" / ""At any rate I should get the 10.30 down to Lawton Hill,"" he urged.""But there is no need,"" she replied, ""there is not the faintest need for you to come home to-night. It is really absurd of you. Think of all the discomfort! Indeed I should not want to come trailing dismally home at midnight, I should not indeed. You would be simply wretched. Stay and have a jolly evening with Cyril."" / He kept his head bent over his plate and did not reply. His persistence irritated her slightly. / ""That is what you can do!"" she said. ""Go to the pantomime. Or wait—go to Maeterlinck's 'Blue Bird.' I am sure that is on somewhere. I wonder if Rebecca has destroyed yesterday's paper. Do you mind touching the bell, Cyril?"" Rebecca came, and the paper was discovered. Lettie carefully read the notices, and planned for us with zest a delightful programme for the evening. Leslie listened to it all in silence. / When the time had come for our departure Lettie came with us into the hall to see that we were well wrapped up. Leslie had spoken very few words. She was conscious that he was deeply offended, but her manner was quite calm, and she petted us both brightly. / ""Good-bye dear!"" she said to him, when he came mutely to kiss her. ""You know it would have been miserable for you to sit all those hours in the train at night. You will have ever such a jolly time. I know you will. I shall look for you to-morrow. Good-bye, then, Good-bye!"" / He went down the steps and into the car without looking at her. She waited in the doorway as we moved round. In the black-grey morning she seemed to harbour the glittering blue sky and the sunshine of March in her dress and her luxuriant hair. He did not look at her till we were curving to the great, snow-cumbered rhododendrons, when, at the last moment he stood up in a sudden panic to wave to her. Almost as he saw her the bushes came between them and he dropped dejectedly into his seat. / ""Good-bye!"" we heard her call cheerfully and tenderly like a blackbird. / ""Good-bye!"" I answered, and: ""Good-bye Darling, Good-bye!"" he cried, suddenly starting up in a passion of forgiveness and tenderness. / The car went cautiously down the soddened white path, under the trees. / I suffered acutely the sickness of exile in Norwood. For weeks I wandered the streets of the suburb, haunted by the spirit of some part of Nethermere. As I went along the quiet roads where the lamps in yellow loneliness stood among the leafless trees of the night I would feel the feeling of the dark, wet bit of path between the wood meadow and the brooks. The spirit of that wild little slope to the Mill would come upon me, and there in the suburb of London I would walk wrapt in the sense of a small wet place in the valley of Nethermere. A strange voice within me rose and called for the hill path; again I could feel the wood waiting for me, calling and calling, and I crying for the wood, yet the space of many miles was between us. Since I left the valley of home I have not much feared any other loss. The hills of Nethermere had been my walls, and the sky of Nethermere my roof overhead. It seemed almost as if, at home, I might lift my hand to the ceiling of the valley, and touch my own beloved sky, whose familiar clouds came again and again to visit me, whose stars were constant to me, born when I was born, whose sun had been all my father to me. But now the skies were strange over my head, and Orion walked past me unnoticing, he who night after night had stood over the woods to spend with me a wonderful hour. When does day now lift up the confines of my dwelling place, when does the night throw open her vastness for me, and send me the stars for company? There is no night in a city. How can I lose myself in the magnificent forest of darkness when night is only a thin scattering of the trees of shadow with barrenness of lights between! / I could never lift my eyes save to the Crystal Palace, crouching, cowering wretchedly among the yellow-grey clouds, pricking up its two round towers like pillars of anxious misery. No landmark could have been more foreign to me, more depressing, than the great dilapidated palace which lay forever prostrate above us, fretting because of its own degradation and ruin. / I watched the buds coming on the brown almond trees; I heard the blackbirds, and I saw the restless starlings; in the streets were many heaps of violets, and men held forward to me snowdrops whose white mute lips were pushed upwards in a bunch: but these things had no meaning for me, and little interest. / Most eagerly I waited for my letters. Emily wrote to me very constantly: / ""Don't you find it quite exhilarating, almost intoxicating, to be so free? I think it is quite wonderful. At home you cannot live your own life. You have to struggle to keep even a little apart for yourself. It is so hard to stand aloof from our mothers, and yet they are only hurt and insulted if you tell them what is in your heart. It is such a relief not to have to be anything to anybody, but just to please yourself. I am sure mother and I have suffered a great deal from trying to keep up our old relations. Yet she would not let me go. When I come home in the evening and think that I needn't say anything to anybody, nor do anything for anybody, but just have the evening for myself, I am overjoyed.""I have begun to write a story——"" / Again, a little later, she wrote: / ""As I go to school by Old Brayford village in the morning the birds are thrilling wonderfully and everything seems stirring. Very likely there will be a set-back, and after that spring will come in truth. / ""When shall you come and see me? I cannot think of a spring without you. The railways are the only fine exciting things here—one is only a few yards away from school. All day long I am watching the great Midland trains go south. They are very lucky to be able to rush southward through the sunshine. / ""The crows are very interesting. They flap past all the time we're out in the yard. The railways and the crows make the charm of my life in Brayford. The other day I saw no end of pairs of crows. Do you remember what they say at home?—'One for sorrow.' Very often one solitary creature sits on the telegraph wires. I almost hate him when I look at him. I think my badge for life ought to be—one crow——."" / Again, a little later: / ""I have been home for the week-end. Isn't it nice to be made much of, to be an important cherished person for a little time? It is quite a new experience for me. / ""The snowdrops are full out among the grass in the front garden—and such a lot. I imagined you must come in the sunshine of the Sunday afternoon to see them. It did not seem possible you should not. The winter aconites are out along the hedge. I knelt and kissed them. I have been so glad to go away, to breathe the free air of life, but I felt as if I could not come away from the aconites. I have sent you some—are they much withered? / ""Now I am in my lodgings, I have the quite unusual feeling of being contented to stay here a little while—not long—not above a year, I am sure. But even to be contented for a little while is enough for me——."" / In the beginning of March I had a letter from the father: / ""You'll not see us again in the old place. We shall be gone in a fortnight. The things are most of them gone already. George has got Bob and Flower. I have sold three of the cows, Stafford, and Julia and Hannah. The place looks very empty. I don't like going past the cowsheds, and we miss hearing the horses stamp at night. But I shall not be sorry when we have really gone. I begin to feel as if we'd stagnated here. I begin to feel as if I was settling and getting narrow and dull. It will be a new lease of life to get away. / ""But I'm wondering how we shall be over there. Mrs. Saxton feels very nervous about going. But at the worst we can but come back. I feel as if I must go somewhere, it's stagnation and starvation for us here. I wish George would come with me. I never thought he would have taken to public-house keeping, but he seems to like it all right. He was down with Meg on Sunday. Mrs. Saxton says he's getting a public-house tone. He is certainly much livelier, more full of talk than he was. Meg and he seem very comfortable, I'm glad to say. He's got a good milk-round, and I've no doubt but what he'll do well. He is very cautious at the bottom; he'll never lose much if he never makes much. / ""Sam and David are very great friends. I'm glad I've got the boy. We often talk of you. It would be very lonely if it wasn't for the excitement of selling things and so on. Mrs. Saxton hopes you will stick by George. She worries a bit about him, thinking he may go wrong. I don't think he will ever go far. But I should be glad to know you were keeping friends. Mrs. Saxton says she will write to you about it——.""George was a very poor correspondent. I soon ceased to expect a letter from him. I received one directly after the father's. / ""My Dear Cyril, / ""Forgive me for not having written you before, but you see, I cannot sit down and write to you any time. If I cannot do it just when I am in the mood, I cannot do it at all. And it so often happens that the mood comes upon me when I am in the fields at work, when it is impossible to write. Last night I sat by myself in the kitchen on purpose to write to you, and then I could not. All day, at Greymede, when I was drilling in the fallow at the back of the church, I had been thinking of you, and I could have written there if I had had materials, but I had not, and at night I could not. / ""I am sorry to say that in my last letter I did not thank you for the books. I have not read them both, but I have nearly finished Evelyn Innes. I get a bit tired of it towards the end. I do not do much reading now. There seems to be hardly any chance for me, either somebody is crying for me in the smoke room, or there is some business, or else Meg won't let me. She doesn't like me to read at night, she says I ought to talk to her, so I have to. / ""It is half-past seven, and I am sitting ready dressed to go and talk to Harry Jackson about a young horse he wants to sell to me. He is in pretty low water, and it will make a pretty good horse. But I don't care much whether I have it or not. The mood seized me to write to you. Somehow at the bottom I feel miserable and heavy, yet there is no need. I am making pretty good money, and I've got all I want. But when I've been ploughing and getting the oats in those fields on the hillside at the back of Greymede church, I've felt as if I didn't care whether I got on or not. It's very funny. Last week I made over five pounds clear, one way and another, and yet now I'm as restless, and discontented as I can be, and I seem eager for something, but I don't know what it is. Sometimes I wonder where I am going. Yesterday I watched broken white masses of cloud sailing across the sky in a fresh strong wind. They all seemed to be going somewhere. I wondered where the wind was blowing them. I don't seem to have hold on anything, do I? Can you tell me what I want at the bottom of my heart? I wish you were here, then I think I should not feel like this. But generally I don't, generally I am quite jolly, and busy. / ""By jove, here's Harry Jackson come for me. I will finish this letter when I get back. / ""——I have got back, we have turned out, but I cannot finish. I cannot tell you all about it. I've had a little row with Meg. Oh, I've had a rotten time. But I cannot tell you about it to-night, it is late, and I am tired, and have a headache. Some other time perhaps—— / GEORGE SAXTON."" / The spring came bravely, even in south London, and the town was filled with magic. I never knew the sumptuous purple of evening till I saw the round arc-lamps fill with light, and roll like golden bubbles along the purple dusk of the high road. Everywhere at night the city is filled with the magic of lamps: over the river they pour in golden patches their floating luminous oil on the restless darkness; the bright lamps float in and out of the cavern of London Bridge Station like round shining bees in and out of a black hive; in the suburbs the street lamps glimmer with the brightness of lemons among the trees. I began to love the town. / In the mornings I loved to move in the aimless street's procession, watching the faces come near to me, with the sudden glance of dark eyes, watching the mouths of the women blossom with talk as they passed, watching the subtle movements of the shoulders of men beneath their coats, and the naked warmth of their necks that went glowing along the street. I loved the city intensely for its movement of men and women, the soft, fascinating flow of the limbs of men and women, and the sudden flash of eyes and lips as they pass. Among all the faces of the street my attention roved like a bee which clambers drunkenly among blue flowers. I became intoxicated with the strange nectar which I sipped out of the eyes of the passers-by. / I did not know how time was hastening by on still bright wings, till I saw the scarlet hawthorn flaunting over the road, and the lime-buds lit up like wine drops in the sun, and the pink scarves of the lime-buds pretty as louse-wort a-blossom in the gutters, and a silver-pink tangle of almond boughs against the blue sky. The lilacs came out, and in the pensive stillness of the suburb, at night, came the delicious tarry scent of lilac flowers, wakening a silent laughter of romance. / Across all this, strangely, came the bleak sounds of home. Alice wrote to me at the end of May: / ""Cyril dear, prepare yourself. Meg has got twins—yesterday. I went up to see how she was this afternoon, not knowing anything, and there I found a pair of bubs in the nest, and old ma Stainwright bossing the show. I nearly fainted. Sybil dear, I hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry when I saw those two rummy little round heads, like two larch cones cheek by cheek on a twig. One is a darkie, with lots of black hair, and the other is red, would you believe it, just lit up with thin red hair like a flicker of firelight. I gasped. I believe I did shed a few tears, though what for, I don't know. / ""The old grandma is a perfect old wretch over it. She lies chuckling and passing audible remarks in the next room, as pleased as punch really, but so mad because ma Stainwright wouldn't have them taken in to her. You should have heard her when we took them in at last. They are both boys. She did make a fuss, poor old woman. I think she's going a bit funny in the head. She seemed sometimes to think they were hers, and you should have heard her, the way she talked to them, it made me feel quite funny. She wanted them lying against her on the pillow, so that she could feel them with her face. I shed a few more tears, Sybil. I think I must be going dotty also. But she came round when we took them away, and began to chuckle to herself, and talk about the things she'd say to George when he came—awful shocking things, Sybil, made me blush dreadfully. / ""Georgie didn't know about it then. He was down at Bingham, buying some horses, I believe. He seems to have got a craze for buying horses. He got in with Harry Jackson and Mayhew's sons—you know, they were horse dealers—at least their father was. You remember he died bankrupt about three years ago. There are Fred and Duncan left, and they pretend to keep on the old business. They are always up at the Ram, and Georgie is always driving about with them. I don't like it—they are a loose lot, rather common, and poor enough now. / ""Well, I thought I'd wait and see Georgie. He came about half-past five. Meg had been fidgeting about him, wondering where he was, and how he was, and so on. Bless me if I'd worry and whittle about a man. The old grandma heard the cart, and before he could get down she shouted—you know her room is in the front—'Hi, George, ma lad, sharpen thy shins an' com' an' a'e a look at 'em—thee'r's two on 'em, two on 'em!' and she laughed something awful. / ""''Ello Granma, what art ter shoutin' about?' he said, and at the sound of his voice Meg turned to me so pitiful, and said: / ""' He's been wi' them Mayhews."" / ""'Tha's gotten twins, a couple at a go ma lad!' shouted the old woman, and you know how she gives squeal before she laughs! She made the horse shy, and he swore at it something awful. Then Bill took it, and Georgie came upstairs. I saw Meg seem to shrink when she heard him kick at the stairs as he came up, and she went white. When he got to the top he came in. He fairly reeked of whisky and horses. Bah, a man is hateful when he reeks of drink! He stood by the side of the bed grinning like a fool, and saying, quite thick: / ""' You've bin in a bit of a 'urry, 'aven't you Meg. An' how are ter feelin' then?' / ""'Oh, I'm a' right,' said Meg. / ""'Is it twins, straight?' he said, 'wheer is 'em?' / ""Meg looked over at the cradle, and he went round the bed to it, holding to the bed-rail. He had never kissed her, nor anything. When he saw the twins, asleep with their fists shut tight as wax, he gave a laugh as if he was amused, and said: / ""' Two right enough—an' one on 'em red! Which is the girl, Meg, the black un?' / ""'They're both boys,' said Meg, quite timidly. / ""He turned round, and his eyes went little. / ""'Blast 'em then!' he said. He stood there looking like a devil. Sybil dear, I did not know our George could look like that. I thought he could only look like a faithful dog or a wounded stag. But he looked fiendish. He stood watching the poor little twins, scowling at them, till at last the little red one began to whine a bit. Ma Stainwright came pushing her fat carcass in front of him and bent over the baby, saying: / ""'Why, my pretty, what are they doin' to thee, what are they?—what are they doin' to thee?' / ""Georgie scowled blacker than ever, and went out, lurching against the wash-stand and making the pots rattle till my heart jumped in my throat. / ""'Well, if you don't call that scandylos——!' said old Ma Stainwright, and Meg began to cry. You don't know, Cyril! She sobbed fit to break her heart. I felt as if I could have killed him. / ""That old gran'ma began talking to him, and he laughed at her. I do hate to hear a man laugh when he's half drunk. It makes my blood boil all of a sudden. That old grandmother backs him up in everything, she's a regular nuisance. Meg has cried to me before over the pair of them. The wicked, vulgar old thing that she is——"" / I went home to Woodside early in September. Emily was staying at the Ram. It was strange that everything was so different. Nethermere even had changed. Nethermere was no longer a complete, wonderful little world that held us charmed inhabitants. It was a small, insignificant valley lost in the spaces of the earth. The tree that had drooped over the brook with such delightful, romantic grace was a ridiculous thing when I came home after a year of absence in the south. The old symbols were trite and foolish. / Emily and I went down one morning to Strelley Mill. The house was occupied by a labourer and his wife, strangers from the north. He was tall, very thin, and silent, strangely suggesting kinship with the rats of the place. She was small and very active, like some ragged domestic fowl run wild. Already Emily had visited her, so she invited us into the kitchen of the mill, and set forward the chairs for us. The large room had the barren air of a cell. There was a small table stranded towards the fireplace, and a few chairs by the walls; for the rest, desert spaces of flagged floor retreating into shadow. On the walls by the windows were five cages of canaries, and the small sharp movements of the birds made the room more strange in its desolation. When we began to talk the birds began to sing, till we were quite bewildered, for the little woman spoke Glasgow Scotch, and she had a hare lip. She rose and ran toward the cages, crying herself like some wild fowl, and flapping a duster at the warbling canaries. / ""Stop it, stop it!"" she cried, shaking her thin weird body at them. ""Silly little devils, fools, fools, fools!!"" and she flapped the duster till the birds were subdued. Then she brought us delicious scones and apple jelly, urging us, almost nudging us with her thin elbows to make us eat. / ""Don't you like 'em, don't you? Well eat 'em, eat 'em then. Go on Emily, go on, eat some more. Only don't tell Tom—don't tell Tom when 'e comes in,""—she shook her head and laughed her shrilling, weird laughter. / As we were going she came out with us, and went running on in front. We could not help noting how ragged and unkempt was her short black skirt. But she hastened around us, hither and thither like an excited fowl, talking in her high-pitched, unintelligible manner. I could not believe the brooding mill was in her charge. I could not think this was the Strelley Mill of a year ago. She fluttered up the steep orchard bank in front of us. Happening to turn round and see Emily and me smiling at each other she began to laugh her strident, weird laughter saying, with a leer: / ""Emily, he's your sweetheart, your sweetheart Emily! You never told me!"" and she laughed aloud. / We blushed furiously. She came away from the edge of the sluice gully, nearer to us, crying: / ""You've been here o' nights, haven't you Emily—haven't you?"" and she laughed again. Then she sat down suddenly, and pointing above our heads, shrieked: / ""Ah, look there""—we looked and saw the mistletoe. ""Look at her, look at her! How many kisses a night, Emily?—Ha! Ha! kisses all the year! Kisses o' nights in a lonely place."" / She went on wildly for a short time, then she dropped her voice and talked in low, pathetic tones. She pressed on us scones and jelly and oat-cakes, and we left her. / When we were out on the road by the brook Emily looked at me with shamefaced, laughing eyes. I noticed a small movement of her lips, and in an instant I found myself kissing her, laughing with some of the little woman's wildness. / CHAPTER III / DOMESTIC LIFE AT THE RAM / George was very anxious to receive me at his home. The Ram had as yet only a six days licence, so on Sunday afternoon I walked over to tea. It was very warm and still and sunny as I came through Greymede. A few sweethearts were sauntering under the horse-chestnut trees, or crossing the road to go into the fields that lay smoothly carpeted after the hay-harvest. / As I came round the flagged track to the kitchen door of the Inn I heard the slur of a baking tin and the bang of the oven door, and Meg saying crossly: / ""No, don't you take him Emily—naughty little thing! Let his father hold him!"" / One of the babies was crying. / I entered, and found Meg all flushed and untidy, wearing a large white apron, just rising from the oven. Emily, in a cream dress, was taking a red-haired, crying baby from out of the cradle. George sat in the small arm-chair, smoking and looking cross. / ""I can't shake hands,"" said Meg, rather flurried. ""I am all floury. Sit down, will you——"" and she hurried out of the room. Emily looked up from the complaining baby to me and smiled a woman's rare, intimate smile, which says: ""See, I am engaged thus for a moment, but I keep my heart for you all the time."" / George rose and offered me the round arm-chair. It was the highest honour he could do me. He asked me what I would drink. When I refused everything, he sat down heavily on the sofa, frowning, and angrily cudgelling his wits for something to say—in vain. / The room was large and comfortably furnished with rush-chairs, a glass-knobbed dresser, a cupboard with glass doors, perched on a shelf in the corner, and the usual large sofa whose cosy loose-bed and pillows were covered with red cotton stuff. There was a peculiar reminiscence of victuals and drink in the room; beer, and a touch of spirits, and bacon. Teenie, the sullen, black-browed servant girl came in carrying the other baby, and Meg called from the scullery to ask her if the child were asleep. Meg was evidently in a bustle and a flurry, a most uncomfortable state. / ""No,"" replied Teenie, ""he's not for sleep this day."" / ""Mend the fire and see to the oven, and then put him his frock on,"" replied Meg testily. Teenie set the black-haired baby in the second cradle. Immediately he began to cry, or rather to shout his remonstrance. George went across to him and picked up a white furry rabbit, which he held before the child: / ""Here, look at bun-bun! Have your nice rabbit! Hark at it squeaking!"" / The baby listened for a moment, then, deciding that this was only a put-off, began to cry again. George threw down the rabbit and took the baby, swearing inwardly. He dandled the child on his knee. / ""What's up then?—What's up wi' thee? Have a ride then—dee-de-dee-de-dee!"" / But the baby knew quite well what was the father's feeling towards him, and he continued to cry. / ""Hurry up, Teenie!"" said George as the maid rattled the coal on the fire. Emily was walking about hushing her charge, and smiling at me, so that I had a peculiar pleasure in gathering for myself the honey of endearment which she shed on the lips of the baby. George handed over his child to the maid, and said to me with patient sarcasm: / ""Will you come in the garden?"" / I rose and followed him across the sunny flagged yard, along the path between the bushes. He lit his pipe and sauntered along as a man on his own estate does, feeling as if he were untrammeled by laws or conventions. / ""You know,"" he said, ""she's a dam rotten manager."" / I laughed, and remarked how full of plums the trees were. / ""Yes!"" he replied heedlessly—""you know she ought to have sent the girl out with the kids this afternoon, and have got dressed directly. But no, she must sit gossiping with Emily all the time they were asleep, and then as soon as they wake up she begins to make cake——"" / ""I suppose she felt she'd enjoy a pleasant chat, all quiet,"" I answered. / ""But she knew quite well you were coming, and what it would be. But a woman's no dam foresight."" / ""Nay, what does it matter!"" said I. / ""Sunday's the only day we can have a bit of peace, so she might keep 'em quiet then."" / ""I suppose it was the only time, too, that she could have a quiet gossip,"" I replied. / ""But you don't know,"" he said, ""there seems to be never a minute of freedom. Teenie sleeps in now, and lives with us in the kitchen—Oswald as well—so I never know what it is to have a moment private. There doesn't seem a single spot anywhere where I can sit quiet. It's the kids all day, and the kids all night, and the servants, and then all the men in the house—I sometimes feel as if I should like to get away. I shall leave the pub as soon as I can—only Meg doesn't want to."" / ""But if you leave the public-house—what then?"" / ""I should like to get back on a farm. This is no sort of a place, really, for farming. I've always got some business on hand, there's a traveller to see, or I've got to go to the brewers, or I've somebody to look at a horse, or something. Your life's all messed up. If I had a place of my own, and farmed it in peace——"" / ""You'd be as miserable as you could be,"" I said. / ""Perhaps so,"" he assented, in his old reflective manner. ""Perhaps so! Anyhow, I needn't bother, for I feel as if I never shall go back—to the land."" / ""Which means at the bottom of your heart you don't intend to,"" I said laughing. / ""Perhaps so!"" he again yielded. ""You see I'm doing pretty well here—apart from the public-house: I always think that's Meg's. Come and look in the stable. I've got a shire mare and two nags: pretty good. I went down to Melton Mowbray with Tom Mayhew, to a chap they've had dealings with. Tom's all right, and he knows how to buy, but he is such a lazy careless devil, too lazy to be bothered to sell——"" / George was evidently interested. As we went round to the stables, Emily came out with the baby, which was dressed in a new silk frock. She advanced, smiling to me with dark eyes: / ""See, now he is good! Doesn't he look pretty?"" / She held the baby for me to look at. I glanced at it, but I was only conscious of the near warmth of her cheek, and of the scent of her hair. / ""Who is he like?"" I asked, looking up and finding myself full in her eyes. The question was quite irrelevant: her eyes spoke a whole clear message that made my heart throb; yet she answered. / ""Who is he? Why, nobody, of course! But he will be like father, don't you think?"" / The question drew my eyes to hers again, and again we looked each other the strange intelligence that made her flush and me breathe in as I smiled. / ""Ay! Blue eyes like your father's—not like yours——"" / Again the wild messages in her looks. / ""No!"" she answered very softly. ""And I think he'll be jolly, like father—they have neither of them our eyes, have they?"" / ""No,"" I answered, overcome by a sudden hot flush of tenderness. ""No—not vulnerable. To have such soft, vulnerable eyes as you used makes one feel nervous and irascible. But you have clothed over the sensitiveness of yours, haven't you?—like naked life, naked defenceless protoplasm they were, is it not so?"" / She laughed, and at the old painful memories she dilated in the old way, and I felt the old tremor at seeing her soul flung quivering on my pity. / ""And were mine like that?"" asked George, who had come up. / He must have perceived the bewilderment of my look as I tried to adjust myself to him. A slight shadow, a slight chagrin appeared on his face. / ""Yes,"" I answered, ""yes—but not so bad. You never gave yourself away so much—you were most cautious: but just as defenceless."" / ""And am I altered?"" he asked, with quiet irony, as if he knew I was not interested in him. / ""Yes, more cautious. You keep in the shadow. But Emily has clothed herself, and can now walk among the crowd at her own gait."" / It was with an effort I refrained from putting my lips to kiss her at that moment as she looked at me with womanly dignity and tenderness. Then I remembered, and said: / ""But you are taking me to the stable George! Come and see the horses too, Emily."" / ""I will. I admire them so much,"" she replied, and thus we both indulged him. / He talked to his horses and of them, laying his hand upon them, running over their limbs. The glossy, restless animals interested him more than anything. He broke into a little flush of enthusiasm over them. They were his new interest. They were quiet and yet responsive; he was their master and owner. This gave him real pleasure. / But the baby became displeased again. Emily looked at me for sympathy with him. / ""He is a little wanderer,"" she said, ""he likes to be always moving. Perhaps he objects to the ammonia of stables too,"" she added, frowning and laughing slightly, ""it is not very agreeable, is it?"" / ""Not particularly,"" I agreed, and as she moved off I went with her, leaving him in the stables. When Emily and I were alone we sauntered aimlessly back to the garden. She persisted in talking to the baby, and in talking to me about the baby, till I wished the child in Jericho. This made her laugh, and she continued to tantalise me. The holly-hock flowers of the second whorl were flushing to the top of the spires. The bees, covered with pale crumbs of pollen, were swaying a moment outside the wide gates of the florets, then they swung in with excited hum, and clung madly to the fury white capitols, and worked riotously round the waxy bases. Emily held out the baby to watch, talking all the time in low, fond tones. The child stretched towards the bright flowers. The sun glistened on his smooth hair as on bronze dust, and the wondering blue eyes of the baby followed the bees. Then he made small sounds, and suddenly waved his hands, like rumpled pink holly-hock buds. / ""Look!"" said Emily, ""look at the little bees! Ah, but you mustn't touch them, they bite. They're coming!"" she cried, with sudden laughing apprehension, drawing the child away. He made noises of remonstrance. She put him near to the flowers again till he knocked the spire with his hand and two indignant bees came sailing out. Emily drew back quickly crying in alarm, then laughing with excited eyes at me, as if she had just escaped a peril in my presence. Thus she teased me by flinging me all kinds of bright gages of love while she kept me aloof because of the child. She laughed with pure pleasure at this state of affairs, and delighted the more when I frowned, till at last I swallowed my resentment and laughed too, playing with the hands of the baby, and watching his blue eyes change slowly like a softly sailing sky. / Presently Meg called us in to tea. She wore a dress of fine blue stuff with cream silk embroidery, and she looked handsome, for her hair was very hastily dressed. / ""What, have you had that child all this time?"" she exclaimed, on seeing Emily. ""Where is his father?"" / ""I don't know—we left him in the stable, didn't we Cyril? But I like nursing him, Meg. I like it ever so much,"" replied Emily. / ""Oh, yes, you may be sure George would get off it if he could. He's always in the stable. As I tell him, he fair stinks of horses. He's not that fond of the children, I can tell you. Come on, my pet—why, come to its mammy."" / She took the baby and kissed it passionately, and made extravagant love to it. A clean shaven young man with thick bare arms went across the yard. / ""Here, just look and tell George as tea is ready,"" said Meg. / ""Where is he?"" asked Oswald, the sturdy youth who attended to the farm business. / ""You know where to find him,"" replied Meg, with that careless freedom which was so subtly derogatory to her husband. / George came hurrying from the out-building. ""What, is it tea already?"" he said. / ""It's a wonder you haven't been crying out for it this last hour,"" said Meg. / ""It's a marvel you've got dressed so quick,"" he replied. / ""Oh, is it?"" she answered—""well, it's not with any of your help that I've done it, that is a fact. Where's Teenie?"" / The maid, short, stiffly built, very dark and sullen looking, came forward from the gate. / ""Can you take Alfy as well, just while we have tea?"" she asked. Teenie replied that she should think she could, whereupon she was given the ruddy-haired baby, as well as the dark one. She sat with them on a seat at the end of the yard. We proceeded to tea. / It was a very great spread. There were hot cakes, three or four kinds of cold cakes, tinned apricots, jellies, tinned lobster, and trifles in the way of jam, cream, and rum. / ""I don't know what those cakes are like,"" said Meg. ""I made them in such a fluster. Really, you have to do things as best you can when you've got children—especially when there's two. I never seem to have time to do my hair up even—look at it now."" / She put up her hands to her head, and I could not help noticing how grimy and rough were her nails. / The tea was going on pleasantly when one of the babies began to cry. Teenie bent over it crooning gruffly. I leaned back and looked out of the door to watch her. I thought of the girl in Tchekoff's story, who smothered her charge, and I hoped the grim Teenie would not be driven to such desperation. The other child joined in this chorus. Teenie rose from her seat and walked about the yard, gruffly trying to soothe the twins. / ""It's a funny thing, but whenever anybody comes they're sure to be cross,"" said Meg, beginning to simmer. / ""They're no different from ordinary,"" said George, ""it's only that you're forced to notice it then."" / ""No, it is not!"" cried Meg in a sudden passion: ""Is it now, Emily? Of course, he has to say something! Weren't they as good as gold this morning, Emily?—and yesterday!—why they never murmured, as good as gold they were. But he wants them to be as dumb as fishes: he'd like them shutting up in a box as soon as they make a bit of noise."" / ""I was not saying anything about it,"" he replied. / ""Yes, you were,"" she retorted. ""I don't know what you call it then——"" / The babies outside continued to cry. / ""Bring Alfy to me,"" called Meg, yielding to the mother feeling. / ""Oh, no, damn it!"" said George, ""let Oswald take him."" / ""Yes,"" replied Meg bitterly, ""let anybody take him so long as he's out of your sight. You never ought to have children, you didn't——"" / George murmured something about ""to-day."" / ""Come then!"" said Meg with a whole passion of tenderness, as she took the red-haired baby and held it to her bosom, ""Why, what is it then, what is it, my precious? Hush then pet, hush then!"" / The baby did not hush. Meg rose from her chair and stood rocking the baby in her arms, swaying from one foot to the other. / ""He's got a bit of wind,"" she said. / We tried to continue the meal, but everything was awkward and difficult. / ""I wonder if he's hungry,"" said Meg, ""let's try him."" / She turned away and gave him her breast. Then he was still, so she covered herself as much as she could, and sat down again to tea. We had finished, so we sat and waited while she ate. This disjointing of the meal, by reflex action, made Emily and me more accurate. We were exquisitely attentive, and polite to a nicety. Our very speech was clipped with precision, as we drifted to a discussion of Strauss and Debussy. This of course put a breach between us two and our hosts, but we could not help it; it was our only way of covering over the awkwardness of the occasion. George sat looking glum and listening to us. Meg was quite indifferent. She listened occasionally, but her position as mother made her impregnable. She sat eating calmly, looking down now and again at her baby, holding us in slight scorn, babblers that we were. She was secure in her high maternity; she was mistress and sole authority. George, as father, was first servant; as an indifferent father, she humiliated him and was hostile to his wishes. Emily and I were mere intruders, feeling ourselves such. After tea we went upstairs to wash our hands. The grandmother had had a second stroke of paralysis, and lay inert, almost stupified. Her large bulk upon the bed was horrible to me, and her face, with the muscles all slack and awry, seemed like some cruel cartoon. She spoke a few thick words to me. George asked her if she felt all right, or should he rub her. She turned her old eyes slowly to him. / ""My leg—my leg a bit,"" she said in her strange guttural. / He took off his coat, and pushing his hand under the bed-clothes, sat rubbing the poor old woman's limb patiently, slowly, for some time. She watched him for a moment, then without her turning her eyes from him, he passed out of her vision and she lay staring at nothing, in his direction. / ""There,"" he said at last, ""is that any better then, mother?"" / ""Ay, that's a bit better,"" she said slowly. / ""Should I gi'e thee a drink?"" he asked, lingering, wishing to minister all he could to her before he went. / She looked at him, and he brought the cup. She swallowed a few drops with difficulty. / ""Doesn't it make you miserable to have her always there?"" I asked him, when we were in the next room. He sat down on the large white bed and laughed shortly. / ""We're used to it—we never notice her, poor old gran'ma."" / ""But she must have made a difference to you—she must make a big difference at the bottom, even if you don't know it,"" I said. / ""She'd got such a strong character,"" he said musing, ""—she seemed to understand me. She was a real friend to me before she was so bad. Sometimes I happen to look at her—generally I never see her, you know how I mean—but sometimes I do—and then—it seems a bit rotten——"" / He smiled at me peculiarly, ""—it seems to take the shine off things,"" he added, and then, smiling again with ugly irony—""She's our skeleton in the closet."" He indicated her large bulk. / The church bells began to ring. The grey church stood on a rise among the fields not far away, like a handsome old stag looking over towards the inn. The five bells began to play, and the sound came beating upon the window. / ""I hate Sunday night,"" he said restlessly. / ""Because you've nothing to do?"" I asked. / ""I don't know,"" he said. ""It seems like a gag, and you feel helpless. I don't want to go to church, and hark at the bells, they make you feel uncomfortable."" / ""What do you generally do?"" I asked. / ""Feel miserable—I've been down to Mayhew's these last two Sundays, and Meg's been pretty mad. She says it's the only night I could stop with her, or go out with her. But if I stop with her, what can I do?—and if we go out, it's only for half an hour. I hate Sunday night—it's a dead end."" / When we went downstairs, the table was cleared, and Meg was bathing the dark baby. Thus she was perfect. She handled the bonny, naked child with beauty of gentleness. She kneeled over him nobly. Her arms and her bosom and her throat had a nobility of roundness and softness. She drooped her head with the grace of a Madonna, and her movements were lovely, accurate and exquisite, like an old song perfectly sung. Her voice, playing and soothing round the curved limbs of the baby, was like water, soft as wine in the sun, running with delight. / We watched humbly, sharing the wonder from afar. / Emily was very envious of Meg's felicity. She begged to be allowed to bathe the second baby. Meg granted her bounteous permission: / ""Yes, you can wash him if you like, but what about your frock?"" / Emily, delighted, began to undress the baby whose hair was like crocus petals. Her fingers trembled with pleasure as she loosed the little tapes. I always remember the inarticulate delight with which she took the child in her hands, when at last his little shirt was removed, and felt his soft white limbs and body. A distinct, glowing atmosphere seemed suddenly to burst out around her and the child, leaving me outside. The moment before she had been very near to me, her eyes searching mine, her spirit clinging timidly about me. Now I was put away, quite alone, neglected, forgotten, outside the glow which surrounded the woman and the baby. / ""Ha!—Ha-a-a!"" she said with a deep throated vowel, as she put her face against the child's small breasts, so round, almost like a girl's, silken and warm and wonderful. She kissed him, and touched him, and hovered over him, drinking in his baby sweetnesses, the sweetness of the laughing little mouth's wide, wet kisses, of the round, waving limbs, of the little shoulders so winsomely curving to the arms and the breasts, of the tiny soft neck hidden very warm beneath the chin, tasting deliciously with her lips and her cheeks all the exquisite softness, silkiness, warmth, and tender life of the baby's body. / A woman is so ready to disclaim the body of a man's love; she yields him her own soft beauty with so much gentle patience and regret; she clings to his neck, to his head and his cheeks, fondling them for the soul's meaning that is there, and shrinking from his passionate limbs and his body. It was with some perplexity, some anger and bitterness that I watched Emily moved almost to ecstasy by the baby's small, innocuous person. / ""Meg never found any pleasure in me as she does in the kids,"" said George bitterly, for himself. / The child, laughing and crowing, caught his hands in Emily's hair and pulled dark tresses down, while she cried out in remonstrance, and tried to loosen the small fists that were shut so fast. She took him from the water and rubbed him dry, with marvellous gentle little rubs, he kicking and expostulating. She brought his fine hair into one silken up-springing of ruddy gold like an aureole. She played with his tiny balls of toes, like wee pink mushrooms, till at last she dare detain him no longer, when she put on his flannel and his night-gown and gave him to Meg. / Before carrying him to bed Meg took him to feed him. His mouth was stretched round the nipple as he sucked, his face was pressed close and closer to the breast, his fingers wandered over the fine white globe, blue veined and heavy, trying to hold it. Meg looked down upon him with a consuming passion of tenderness, and Emily clasped her hands and leaned forward to him. Even thus they thought him exquisite. / When the twins were both asleep, I must tiptoe upstairs to see them. They lay cheek by cheek in the crib next the large white bed, breathing little, ruffling breaths, out of unison, so small and pathetic with their tiny shut fingers. I remembered the two larks. / From the next room came a heavy sound of the old woman's breathing. Meg went in to her. As in passing I caught sight of the large, prone figure in the bed, I thought of Guy de Maupassant's ""Toine,"" who acted as an incubator.","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'N/A', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'Literature']}"

It is the most important thing that has ever happened to me. Almost seventy years later I remember clearly how the magic of translating the words in books into images enriched my life, breaking the barriers of time and space and allowing me to travel with Captain Nemo twenty thousand leagues under the sea, fight with d'Artagnan, Athos, Portos, and Aramis against the intrigues threatening the Queen in the days of the secretive Richelieu, or stumble through the sewers of Paris, transformed into Jean Valjean carrying Marius's inert body on my back. / Reading changed dreams into life and life into dreams and placed the universe of literature within reach of the boy I once was. My mother told me the first things I wrote were continuations of the stories I read because it made me sad when they concluded or because I wanted to change their endings. And perhaps this is what I have spent my life doing without realizing it: prolonging in time, as I grew, matured, and aged, the stories that filled my childhood with exaltation and adventures. / I wish my mother were here, a woman who was moved to tears reading the poems of Amado Nervo and Pablo Neruda, and Grandfather Pedro too, with his large nose and gleaming bald head, who celebrated my verses, and Uncle Lucho, who urged me so energetically to throw myself body and soul into writing even though literature, in that time and place, compensated its devotees so badly. Throughout my life I have had people like that at my side, people who loved and encouraged me and infected me with their faith when I had doubts. Thanks to them, and certainly to my obstinacy and some luck, I have been able to devote most of my time to the passion, the vice, the marvel of writing, creating a parallel life where we can take refuge against adversity, one that makes the extraordinary natural and the natural extraordinary, that dissipates chaos, beautifies ugliness, eternalizes the moment, and turns death into a passing spectacle. / Writing stories was not easy. When they were turned into words, projects withered on the paper and ideas and images failed. How to reanimate them? Fortunately, the masters were there, teachers to learn from and examples to follow. Flaubert taught me that talent is unyielding discipline and long patience. Faulkner, that form – writing and structure – elevates or impoverishes subjects. Martorell, Cervantes, Dickens, Balzac, Tolstoy, Conrad, Thomas Mann, that scope and ambition are as important in a novel as stylistic dexterity and narrative strategy. Sartre, that words are acts, that a novel, a play, or an essay, engaged with the present moment and better options, can change the course of history. Camus and Orwell, that a literature stripped of morality is inhuman, and Malraux that heroism and the epic are as possible in the present as is the time of the Argonauts, the Odyssey, and the Iliad. / If in this address I were to summon all the writers to whom I owe a few things or a great deal, their shadows would plunge us into darkness. They are innumerable. In addition to revealing the secrets of the storytelling craft, they obliged me to explore the bottomless depths of humanity, admire its heroic deeds, and feel horror at its savagery. They were my most obliging friends, the ones who vitalized my calling and in whose books I discovered that there is hope even in the worst of circumstances, that living is worth the effort if only because without life we could not read or imagine stories. / At times I wondered whether writing was not a solipsistic luxury in countries like mine, where there were scant readers, so many people who were poor and illiterate, so much injustice, and where culture was a privilege of the few. These doubts, however, never stifled my calling, and I always kept writing even during those periods when earning a living absorbed most of my time. I believe I did the right thing, since if, for literature to flourish, it was first necessary for a society to achieve high culture, freedom, prosperity, and justice, it never would have existed. But thanks to literature, to the consciousness it shapes, the desires and longings it inspires, and our disenchantment with reality when we return from the journey to a beautiful fantasy, civilization is now less cruel than when storytellers began to humanize life with their fables. We would be worse than we are without the good books we have read, more conformist, not as restless, more submissive, and the critical spirit, the engine of progress, would not even exist. Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life. When we look in fiction for what is missing in life, we are saying, with no need to say it or even to know it, that life as it is does not satisfy our thirst for the absolute – the foundation of the human condition – and should be better. We invent fictions in order to live somehow the many lives we would like to lead when we barely have one at our disposal. / Without fictions we would be less aware of the importance of freedom for life to be livable, the hell it turns into when it is trampled underfoot by a tyrant, an ideology, or a religion. Let those who doubt that literature not only submerges us in the dream of beauty and happiness but alerts us to every kind of oppression, ask themselves why all regimes determined to control the behavior of citizens from cradle to grave fear it so much they establish systems of censorship to repress it and keep so wary an eye on independent writers. They do this because they know the risk of allowing the imagination to wander free in books, know how seditious fictions become when the reader compares the freedom that makes them possible and is exercised in them with the obscurantism and fear lying in wait in the real world. Whether they want it or not, know it or not, when they invent stories the writers of tales propagate dissatisfaction, demonstrating that the world is badly made and the life of fantasy richer than the life of our daily routine. This fact, if it takes root in their sensibility and consciousness, makes citizens more difficult to manipulate, less willing to accept the lies of the interrogators and jailers who would like to make them believe that behind bars they lead more secure and better lives. / Good literature erects bridges between different peoples, and by having us enjoy, suffer, or feel surprise, unites us beneath the languages, beliefs, habits, customs, and prejudices that separate us. When the great white whale buries Captain Ahab in the sea, the hearts of readers take fright in exactly the same way in Tokyo, Lima, or Timbuctu. When Emma Bovary swallows arsenic, Anna Karenina throws herself in front of the train, and Julien Sorel climbs to the scaffold, and when, in “El sur,” the urban doctor Juan Dahlmann walks out of that tavern on the pampa to face a thug's knife, or we realize that all the residents of Comala, Pedro Páramo's village, are dead, the shudder is the same in the reader who worships Buddha, Confucius, Christ, Allah, or is an agnostic, wears a jacket and tie, a jalaba, a kimono, or bombachas. Literature creates a fraternity within human diversity and eclipses the frontiers erected among men and women by ignorance, ideologies, religions, languages, and stupidity. / Since every period has its horrors, ours is the age of fanatics, of suicide terrorists, an ancient species convinced that by killing they earn heaven, that the blood of innocents washes away collective affronts, corrects injustices, and imposes truth on false beliefs. Every day, all over the world, countless victims are sacrificed by those who feel they possess absolute truths. With the collapse of totalitarian empires, we believed that living together, peace, pluralism, and human rights would gain the ascendancy and the world would leave behind holocausts, genocides, invasions, and wars of extermination. None of that has occurred. New forms of barbarism flourish, incited by fanaticism, and with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we cannot overlook the fact that any small faction of crazed redeemers may one day provoke a nuclear cataclysm. We have to thwart them, confront them, and defeat them. There aren't many, although the tumult of their crimes resounds all over the planet and the nightmares they provoke overwhelm us with dread. We should not allow ourselves to be intimidated by those who want to snatch away the freedom we have been acquiring over the long course of civilization. Let us defend the liberal democracy that, with all its limitations, continues to signify political pluralism, coexistence, tolerance, human rights, respect for criticism, legality, free elections, alternation in power, everything that has been taking us out of a savage life and bringing us closer – though we will never attain it – to the beautiful, perfect life literature devises, the one we can deserve only by inventing, writing, and reading it. By confronting homicidal fanatics we defend our right to dream and to make our dreams reality. / In my youth, like many writers of my generation, I was a Marxist and believed socialism would be the remedy for the exploitation and social injustices that were becoming more severe in my country, in Latin America, and in the rest of the Third World. My disillusion with statism and collectivism and my transition to the democrat and liberal that I am – that I try to be – was long and difficult and carried out slowly as a consequence of episodes like the conversion of the Cuban Revolution, about which I initially had been enthusiastic, to the authoritarian, vertical model of the Soviet Union; the testimony of dissidents who managed to slip past the barbed wire fences of the Gulag; the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the nations of the Warsaw Pact; and because of thinkers like Raymond Aron, Jean Francois Rével, Isaiah Berlin, and Karl Popper, to whom I owe my reevaluation of democratic culture and open societies. Those masters were an example of lucidity and gallant courage when the intelligentsia of the West, as a result of frivolity or opportunism, appeared to have succumbed to the spell of Soviet socialism or, even worse, to the bloody witches' Sabbath of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. / As a boy I dreamed of coming some day to Paris because, dazzled by French literature, I believed that living there and breathing the air breathed by Balzac, Stendhal, Baudelaire, and Proust would help transform me into a real writer, and if I did not leave Peru I would be only a pseudo Sundays-and-holidays writer. And the truth is I owe to France and French culture unforgettable lessons, for example that literature is as much a calling as it is a discipline, a job, an obstinacy. I lived there when Sartre and Camus were alive and writing, in the years of Ionesco, Beckett, Bataille, and Cioran, the discovery of the theater of Brecht and the films of Ingmar Bergman, the Theatre National Populaire of Jean Vilar and the Odéon of Jean-Louis Barrault, of the Nouvelle Vague and the Nouveau Roman and the speeches, beautiful literary pieces, of André Malraux, and what may have been the most theatrical spectacle in Europe during that time, the press conferences and Olympic thunderings of General de Gaulle. But perhaps I am most grateful to France for the discovery of Latin America. There I learned that Peru was part of a vast community united by history, geography, social and political problems, a certain mode of being, and the delicious language it spoke and wrote. And in those same years, it was producing a new, forceful literature. There I read Borges, Octavio Paz, Cortázar, García Márquez, Fuentes, Cabrera Infante, Rulfo, Onetti, Carpentier, Edwards, Donoso, and many others whose writings were revolutionizing narrative in the Spanish language, and thanks to whom Europe and a good part of the world discovered that Latin America was not the continent only of coups, operetta despots, bearded guerrillas, and the maracas of the mambo and the cha-cha-cha but of ideas, artistic forms, and literary fantasies that transcended the picturesque and spoke a universal language. / From that time to this, not without stumbling and blunders, Latin America has made progress although, as César Vallejo said in a poem, Hay, hermanos, muchísimo que hacer [There is still, brothers, so much to do]. We are afflicted with fewer dictatorships than before, only Cuba and her named successor, Venezuela, and some pseudo populist, clownish democracies like those in Bolivia and Nicaragua. But in the rest of the continent democracy is functioning, supported by a broad popular consensus, and for the first time in our history, as in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and almost all of Central America, we have a left and a right that respect legality, the freedom to criticize, elections, and succession in power. That is the right road, and if it stays on it, combats insidious corruption, and continues to integrate with the world, Latin America will finally stop being the continent of the future and become the continent of the present. / I never felt like a foreigner in Europe or, in fact, anywhere. In all the places I have lived, in Paris, London, Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin, Washington, New York, Brazil, or the Dominican Republic, I felt at home. I have always found a lair where I could live in peace, work, learn things, nurture dreams, and find friends, good books to read, and subjects to write about. It does not seem to me that my unintentionally becoming a citizen of the world has weakened what are called “my roots,” my connections to my own country – which would not be particularly important – because if that were so, my Peruvian experiences would not continue to nourish me as a writer and would not always appear in my stories, even when they seem to occur very far from Peru. I believe instead that living for so long outside the country where I was born has strengthened those connections, adding a more lucid perspective to them, and a nostalgia that can differentiate the adjectival from the substantive and keep memories reverberating. Love of the country where one was born cannot be obligatory, but like any other love must be a spontaneous act of the heart, like the one that unites lovers, parents and children, and friends. / I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling, and there I loved, hated, enjoyed, suffered, and dreamed. What happens there affects me more, moves and exasperates me more than what occurs elsewhere. I have not wished it or imposed it on myself; it simply is so. Some compatriots accused me of being a traitor, and I was on the verge of losing my citizenship when, during the last dictatorship, I asked the democratic governments of the world to penalize the regime with diplomatic and economic sanctions, as I have always done with all dictatorships of any kind, whether of Pinochet, Fidel Castro, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Imams in Iran, apartheid in South Africa, the uniformed satraps of Burma (now called Myanmar). And I would do it again tomorrow if – may destiny not wish it and Peruvians not permit it – Peru were once again the victim of a coup that would annihilate our fragile democracy. It was not the precipitate, emotional action of a resentful man, as some scribblers wrote, accustomed to judging others from the point of view of their own pettiness. It was an act in line with my conviction that a dictatorship represents absolute evil for a country, a source of brutality and corruption and profound wounds that take a long time to close, poison the nation's future, and create pernicious habits and practices that endure for generations and delay democratic reconstruction. This is why dictatorships must be fought without hesitation, with all the means at our disposal, including economic sanctions. It is regrettable that democratic governments, instead of setting an example by making common cause with those, like the Damas de Blanco in Cuba, the Venezuelan opposition, or Aung San Suu Kyi and Liu Xiaobo, who courageously confront the dictatorships they endure, often show themselves complaisant not with them but with their tormenters. Those valiant people, struggling for their freedom, are also struggling for ours. / A compatriot of mine, José María Arguedas, called Peru the country of “every blood.” I do not believe any formula defines it better: that is what we are and that is what all Peruvians carry inside us, whether we like it or not: an aggregate of traditions, races, beliefs, and cultures proceeding from the four cardinal points. I am proud to feel myself the heir to the pre-Hispanic cultures that created the textiles and feather mantles of Nazca and Paracas and the Mochican or Incan ceramics exhibited in the best museums in the world, the builders of Machu Picchu, Gran Chimú, Chan Chan, Kuelap, Sipán, the burial grounds of La Bruja and El Sol and La Luna, and to the Spaniards who, with their saddle bags, swords, and horses, brought to Peru Greece, Rome, the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Renaissance, Cervantes, Quevedo, and Góngora, and the harsh language of Castile sweetened by the Andes. And with Spain came Africa, with its strength, its music, and its effervescent imagination, to enrich Peruvian heterogeneity. If we investigate only a little we discover that Peru, like the Aleph of Borges, is a small format of the entire world. What an extraordinary privilege for a country not to have an identity because it has all of them! / The conquest of America was cruel and violent, like all conquests, of course, and we should criticize it but not forget as we do that those who committed pillage and crimes were, for the most part, our great-grandfathers and great-great-grandfathers, the Spaniards who came to America and adopted American ways, not those who remained in their own country. Such criticism, to be just, should be self-criticism. Because when we gained our independence from Spain two hundred years ago, those who assumed power in the former colonies, instead of liberating the Indians and creating justice for old wrongs, continued to exploit them with as much greed and ferocity as the conquerors and, in some countries, decimating and exterminating them. Let us say this with absolute clarity: for two centuries the emancipation of the indigenous population has been our exclusive responsibility, and we have not fulfilled it. This continues to be an unresolved issue in all of Latin America. There is not a single exception to this ignominy and shame. / I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer and perhaps, like so many unfortunate colleagues, I would wander in the limbo of writers without luck, publishers, prizes, or readers, whose talent – sad comfort – posterity may one day discover. All my books were published in Spain, where I received exaggerated recognition, and friends like Carlos Barral, Carmen Balcells, and so many others were zealous about my stories having readers. And Spain granted me a second nationality when I could have lost mine. I have never felt the slightest incompatibility between being Peruvian and having a Spanish passport, because I have always felt that Spain and Peru are two sides of the same coin, not only in my small person but in essential realities like history, language, and culture. / Of all the years I have lived on Spanish soil, I remember as most brilliant the five I spent in a dearly loved Barcelona in the early 1970s. Franco's dictatorship was still in power and shooting, but by then it was a fossil in rags, and especially in the field of culture, incapable of maintaining its earlier controls. Cracks and chinks were opening that the censors could not patch over, and through them Spanish society absorbed new ideas, books, currents of thought, and artistic values and forms prohibited until then as subversive. No city took as much or better advantage of this start of an opening than Barcelona or experienced a comparable excitement in all fields of ideas and creativity. It became the cultural capital of Spain, the place you had to be to breathe anticipation of the freedom to come. And, in a sense, it was also the cultural capital of Latin America because of the number of painters, writers, publishers, and artists from Latin American countries who either settled in or traveled back and forth to Barcelona: it was where you had to be if you wanted to be a poet, novelist, painter, or composer in our time. For me, those were unforgettable years of comradeship, friendship, plots, and fertile intellectual work. Just as Paris had been, Barcelona was a Tower of Babel, a cosmopolitan, universal city where it was stimulating to live and work and where, for the first time since the days of the Civil War, Spanish and Latin American writers mixed and fraternized, recognizing one another as possessors of the same tradition and allied in a common enterprise and certainty: the end of the dictatorship was imminent and in democratic Spain, culture would be the principal protagonist. / Although it did not occur exactly that way, the Spanish transition from dictatorship to democracy has been one of the best stories of modern times, an example of how, when good sense and reason prevail and political adversaries set aside sectarianism for the common good, events can occur as marvelous as the ones in novels of magic realism. The Spanish transition from authoritarianism to freedom, from underdevelopment to prosperity, from third-world economic contrasts and inequalities to a country of middle classes, her integration into Europe and her adoption in a few years of a democratic culture, has astonished the entire world and precipitated Spain's modernization. It has been moving and instructive for me to experience this near at hand, at times from the inside. I fervently hope that nationalism, the incurable plague of the modern world and of Spain as well, does not ruin this happy tale. / I despise every form of nationalism, a provincial ideology – or rather, religion – that is short-sighted, exclusive, that cuts off the intellectual horizon and hides in its bosom ethnic and racist prejudices, for it transforms into a supreme value, a moral and ontological privilege, the fortuitous circumstance of one's birthplace. Along with religion, nationalism has been the cause of the worst slaughters in history, like those in the two world wars and the current bloodletting in the Middle East. Nothing has contributed as much as nationalism to Latin America's having been Balkanized and stained with blood in senseless battles and disputes, squandering astronomical resources to purchase weapons instead of building schools, libraries, and hospitals. / We should not confuse a blinkered nationalism and its rejection of the “other,” always the seed of violence, with patriotism, a salutary, generous feeling of love for the land where we were born, where our ancestors lived, where our first dreams were forged, a familiar landscape of geographies, loved ones, and events that are transformed into signposts of memory and defenses against solitude. Homeland is not flags, anthems, or apodictic speeches about emblematic heroes, but a handful of places and people that populate our memories and tinge them with melancholy, the warm sensation that no matter where we are, there is a home for us to return to. / Peru is for me Arequipa, where I was born but never lived, a city my mother, grandparents, and aunts and uncles taught me to know through their memories and yearnings, because my entire family tribe, as Arequepeños tend to do, always carried the White City with them in their wandering existence. It is Piura in the desert, mesquite trees and the long-suffering burros that Piurans of my youth called “somebody else's feet” – an elegant, sad name – where I discovered that storks did not bring babies into the world but couples made them by doing outrageous things that were a mortal sin. It is San Miguel Academy and the Varieties Theater where for the first time I saw a short work I had written produced on stage. It is the corner of Diego Ferré and Colón, in Lima's Miraflores – we called it the Happy Neighborhood – where I exchanged short pants for long trousers, smoked my first cigarette, learned to dance, fall in love, and open my heart to girls. It is the dusty, pulsing editorial offices of the paper La Crónica where, at sixteen, I stood virgil over my first arms as a journalist, a trade that, along with literature, has occupied almost my entire life and, like books, has made me live more, know the world better, and be with men and women from everywhere and every class, excellent, good, bad, and execrable people. It is the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, where I learned that Peru was not the small middle-class redoubt where I had lived until then, confined and protected, but a large, ancient, rancorous, unequal country, shaken by all kinds of social storms. It is the clandestine cells of Cahuide where, with a handful of San Marcos students, we prepared the world revolution. And Peru is my friends in the Freedom Movement with whom for three years, in the midst of bombs, blackouts, and terrorist assassinations, we worked in defense of democracy and the culture of freedom. / Peru is Patricia, my cousin with the upturned nose and indomitable character, whom I was lucky enough to marry forty-five years ago and who still endures the manias, neuroses, and temper tantrums that help me to write. Without her my life would have dissolved a long time ago into a turbulent whirlwind, and Alvaro, Gonzalo, Morgana and the six grandchildren who extend and gladden our existence would not have been born. She does everything and does everything well. She solves problems, manages the economy, imposes order on chaos, keeps journalists and intrusive people at bay, defends my time, decides appointments and trips, packs and unpacks suitcases, and is so generous that even when she thinks she is rebuking me, she pays me the highest compliment: “Mario, the only thing you're good for is writing.” / Let us return to literature. The paradise of childhood is not a literary myth for me but a reality I lived and enjoyed in the large family house with three courtyards in Cochabamba, where with my cousins and school friends we could reproduce the stories of Tarzan and Salgari, and in the prefecture of Piura, where bats nested in the lofts, silent shadows that filled the starry nights of that hot land with mystery. During those years, writing was playing a game my family celebrated, something charming that earned applause for me, the grandson, the nephew, the son without a papa because my father had died and gone to heaven. He was a tall, good-looking man in a navy uniform whose photo adorned my night table, which I prayed to and then kissed before going to sleep. One Piuran morning – I do not think I have recovered from it yet – my mother revealed that the gentleman was, in fact, alive. And on that very day we were going to live with him in Lima. I was eleven years old, and from that moment everything changed. I lost my innocence and discovered loneliness, authority, adult life, and fear. My salvation was reading, reading good books, taking refuge in those worlds where life was glorious, intense, one adventure after another, where I could feel free and be happy again. And it was writing, in secret, like someone giving himself up to an unspeakable vice, a forbidden passion. Literature stopped being a game. It became a way of resisting adversity, protesting, rebelling, escaping the intolerable, my reason for living. From then until now, in every circumstance when I have felt disheartened or beaten down, on the edge of despair, giving myself body and soul to my work as a storyteller has been the light at the end of the tunnel, the plank that carries the shipwrecked man to shore. / Although it is very difficult and forces me to sweat blood and, like every writer, to feel at times the threat of paralysis, a dry season of the imagination, nothing has made me enjoy life as much as spending months and years constructing a story, from its uncertain beginnings, the image memory stores of a lived experience that becomes a restlessness, an enthusiasm, a daydream that then germinates into a project and the decision to attempt to convert the agitated cloud of phantoms into a story. “Writing is a way of living,” said Flaubert. Yes, absolutely, a way of living with illusion and joy and a fire throwing out sparks in your head, struggling with intractable words until you master them, exploring the broad world like a hunter tracking down desirable prey to feed an embryonic fiction and appease the voracious appetite of every story that, as it grows, would like to devour every other story. Beginning to feel the vertigo a gestating novel leads us to, when it takes shape and seems to begin to live on its own, with characters that move, act, think, feel, and demand respect and consideration, on whom it is no longer possible to arbitrarily impose behavior or to deprive them of their free will without killing them, without having the story lose its power to persuade – this is an experience that continues to bewitch me as it did the first time, as complete and dizzying as making love to the woman you love for days, weeks, months, without stopping. / When speaking of fiction, I have talked a great deal about the novel and very little about the theater, another of its preeminent forms. A great injustice, of course. Theater was my first love, ever since, as an adolescent, I saw Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman at the Segura Theater in Lima, a performance that left me transfixed with emotion and precipitated my writing a drama with Incas. If there had been a theatrical movement in the Lima of the 1950s, I would have been a playwright rather than a novelist. There was not, and that must have turned me more and more toward narrative. But my love for the theater never ended; it dozed, curled up in the shadow of novels, like a temptation and a nostalgia, above all whenever I saw an enthralling play. In the late 1970s, the persistent memory of a hundred-year-old great-aunt, Mamaé, who in the final years of her life cut off her surrounding reality to take refuge in memories and fiction, suggested a story. And I felt, prophetically, that it was a story for the theater, that only on stage would it take on the animation and splendor of successful fictions. I wrote it with the tremulous excitement of a beginner and so enjoyed seeing it on stage with Norma Aleandro in the heroine's role that since then, between novels and essays, I have relapsed several times. And I must add, I never imagined that at the age of seventy I would mount (I should say, stumble onto) a stage to act. That reckless adventure made me experience for the first time in my own flesh and bone the miracle it is for someone who has spent his life writing fictions to embody for a few hours a character of fantasy, to live the fiction in front of an audience. I can never adequately thank my dear friends, the director Joan Ollé and the actress Aitana Sánchez Gijón, for having encouraged me to share with them that fantastic experience (in spite of the panic that accompanied it). / Literature is a false representation of life that nevertheless helps us to understand life better, to orient ourselves in the labyrinth where we are born, pass by, and die. It compensates for the reverses and frustrations real life inflicts on us, and because of it we can decipher, at least partially, the hieroglyphic that existence tends to be for the great majority of human beings, principally those of us who generate more doubts than certainties and confess our perplexity before subjects like transcendence, individual and collective destiny, the soul, the sense or senselessness of history, the to and fro of rational knowledge. / I have always been fascinated to imagine the uncertain circumstance in which our ancestors – still barely different from animals, the language that allowed them to communicate with one another just recently born – in caves, around fires, on nights seething with the menace of lightning bolts, thunder claps, and growling beasts, began to invent and tell stories. That was the crucial moment in our destiny, because in those circles of primitive beings held by the voice and fantasy of the storyteller, civilization began, the long passage that gradually would humanize us and lead us to invent the autonomous individual, then disengage him from the tribe, devise science, the arts, law, freedom, and to scrutinize the innermost recesses of nature, the human body, space, and travel to the stars. Those tales, fables, myths, legends that resounded for the first time like new music before listeners intimidated by the mysteries and perils of a world where everything was unknown and dangerous, must have been a cool bath, a quiet pool for those spirits always on the alert, for whom existing meant barely eating, taking shelter from the elements, killing, and fornicating. From the time they began to dream collectively, to share their dreams, instigated by storytellers, they ceased to be tied to the treadmill of survival, a vortex of brutalizing tasks, and their life became dream, pleasure, fantasy, and a revolutionary plan: to break out of confinement and change and improve, a struggle to appease the desires and ambitions that stirred imagined lives in them, and the curiosity to clear away the mysteries that filled their surroundings. / This never-interrupted process was enriched when writing was born and stories, in addition to being heard, could be read, achieving the permanence literature confers on them. That is why this must be repeated incessantly until new generations are convinced of it: fiction is more than an entertainment, more than an intellectual exercise that sharpens one's sensibility and awakens a critical spirit. It is an absolute necessity so that civilization continues to exist, renewing and preserving in us the best of what is human. So that we do not retreat into the savagery of isolation and life is not reduced to the pragmatism of specialists who see things profoundly but ignore what surrounds, precedes, and continues those things. So that we do not move from having the machines we invent serve us to being their servants and slaves. And because a world without literature would be a world without desires or ideals or irreverence, a world of automatons deprived of what makes the human being really human: the capacity to move out of oneself and into another, into others, modeled with the clay of our dreams. / From the cave to the skyscraper, from the club to weapons of mass destruction, from the tautological life of the tribe to the era of globalization, the fictions of literature have multiplied human experiences, preventing us from succumbing to lethargy, self-absorption, resignation. Nothing has sown so much disquiet, so disturbed our imagination and our desires as the life of lies we add, thanks to literature, to the one we have, so we can be protagonists in the great adventures, the great passions real life will never give us. The lies of literature become truths through us, the readers transformed, infected with longings and, through the fault of fiction, permanently questioning a mediocre reality. Sorcery, when literature offers us the hope of having what we do not have, being what we are not, acceding to that impossible existence where like pagan gods we feel mortal and eternal at the same time, that introduces into our spirits non-conformity and rebellion, which are behind all the heroic deeds that have contributed to the reduction of violence in human relationships. Reducing violence, not ending it. Because ours will always be, fortunately, an unfinished story. That is why we have to continue dreaming, reading, and writing, the most effective way we have found to alleviate our mortal condition, to defeat the corrosion of time, and to transform the impossible into possibility. / Stockholm, December 7, 2010","{'Producer': 'N/A', 'Writers': '', 'Release Date': 'December 7, 2010', 'Tags': ['Non-Music', 'History', 'Literature']}"
